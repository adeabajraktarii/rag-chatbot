In this decision making process evidence based medicine (EBM) plays an increasingly important role as a tool for rationalising as well as rationing health care resources. In this article, ethical issues of hospital management and the role of EBM will be explored, with particular reference to disease management programs, diagnosis related groups, and clinical pathways as recent developments in the German health care system. W ithout doubt ethical aspects of hospital management need more attention and scrutiny than they have received up to now. Topics such as cloning, research on human stem cells, or preimplantation diagnosis have a much more immediate appeal as important moral issues than a field that is characterised by seemingly dry and technical terms such as ‘‘cost efficiency’’, ‘‘workflow management’’, ‘‘clinical pathways’’, ‘‘process orientation’’, and ‘‘total quality management’’", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

How to allocate available funds to departments, what portfolio of clinical services to offer, or how to assure a reliably high quality of services are matters that do indeed deserve ethical reflection and analysis. They need to be addressed directly and concretely, and not only by way of more general and abstract discussion on health care systems or access to health. In this paper we want to spell out some of the ethical issues of hospital management. In particular, we will focus on the changes that are currently being brought about by the integration of evidence based medicine (EBM) into the hospital setting. In recent years EBM has been shown to be a powerful tool that can be used for various purposes and by different stakeholders in health care systems", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

In recent years EBM has been shown to be a powerful tool that can be used for various purposes and by different stakeholders in health care systems. Asking about the ethical implications of the introduction of EBM into hospital management can thus help to describe some of the major changes this area of medicine is undergoing at the moment, and at the same time contribute to an ethical analysis of EBM and the way it is implemented in practice. ETHICAL ISSUES IN HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT The specific social setting of the hospital abounds in ethical problems and conflicts that neither involve, nor are caused directly by, the hospital management. Rude behaviour towards patients during rounds, sloppy informed consent procedures before the inclusion of patients into clinical trials, or tensions within medical teams frequently do not even reach the management level", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

Nevertheless, hospital managers carry an exceptional responsibility for all activities in hospitals, because of their position in the institutional hierarchy and their decisive influence on the concrete framework within which the delivery of health care is taking place. Although it is less probable that decisions of the management will directly harm individual patients than a mistake by the medical staff, responsible decision making on the part of the hospital management is surely an important precondition if it is to be possible for hospital staff to integrate ethics into their daily work. The hospital manager bears responsibility to at least three parties: the patients who are being treated in the hospital; the staff; and the community that provides the funding for the institution", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 5, "text": ". The longstanding guidelines on Ethical conduct and relationships for health care institutions of the American Hospital Association, (AHA) (first version issued in 1973), 1 describe three corresponding areas of ethical concern: the responsibility of health care institutions for their patients; organisational issues within the hospital; and the community role of health care providers. These areas mirror the relevant interests which come together in the hospital: the interest of society to have effective health care institutions; the interest of patients to be treated adequately in the hospital; and the interest of hospital staff to work in an institution with appropriate ethical and social standards", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 6, "text": ". What do these three areas mean in the context of everyday decisions that have to be taken by hospital managers? As far as the first area is concerned, health care institutions have a special accountability to their patients, due to the particular nature of the relationship between patients and health care providers in the hospital setting, which is usually highly asymmetrical, in terms of knowledge and authority. To protect the patients’ personal rights, the AHA’s code of conduct mentions several instruments, including: informed consent for diagnosis and therapy; the use of advance directives; confidentiality regarding patients’ private data; and respect for social, spiritual, and cultural needs and beliefs. In addition, hospital managements have to ensure continuity of health care for all patients; and at the same time they should enable doctors to offer patients possible treatment alternatives and engage in the improvement of the quality of care and therapy", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 7, "text": ".

Anyone familiar with the impact of rationing in medicine knows, however, that the scarcity of resources for health care produces ethical problems—either of resource allocation, or of a lack of working hours, which may limit staff engagement in activities that are ethically important. Hospital management can use its influence to reduce such problems and to maintain ethical standards. As in any other enterprise, employees and medical staff deserve fair compensation, fair benefits, and the opportunity to take part in continuing education in order to steadily improve the quality of health care. As far as the third area is concerned, the community role of health care providers requires hospitals to structure their health care provision so as to adequately meet the needs of the society in a specific local setting, in order to fulfil their public functions", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 9, "text": ". Given that there are no clear upper limits to the demand and supply of medical goods as illustrated—for example, by the much discussed definition of health offered by the World Health Organisation (WHO)—it is necessary to use some rational criteria for resource allocation. Health care institutions must also give special consideration to the needs and medical problems of vulnerable groups, whether their vulnerability results from a specific lack of autonomy (as in the case of the very young, the elderly, or psychiatric patients), or from social marginalisation, as in the case of poor or inadequately insured people. Finally, health care institutions are financed by the fees of the insured or by other kinds of public funding and have therefore special duties to make ‘‘fair and effective use of available health care delivery resources’’.1 Hospital management is responsible to the public, at least in cases when it is the public which makes possible the existence and running of hospitals", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 10, "text": ". In sum, hospital managers can exercise influence aimed at promoting ethical health care over a wide range of organisational features. Although medical ethics mainly deals with conflicts between the patients and their health care providers, it is clear to us that the features which frame the institutional setting, such as the hospital, in which such conflicts take place, are of considerable importance as well for finding appropriate solutions. The emergence and formulation of common and consensual codes of conduct in many hospitals today can be interpreted as a sign of a growing consciousness of such a wider perception of factors shaping moral conflicts in medicine. ON THE ROLE OF EBM IN HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT The tasks of hospital management can be described as pertaining to two large areas: quality management and allocation of resources. These are exactly the two areas where EBM has been put to use", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 11, "text": ". These are exactly the two areas where EBM has been put to use. 23 EBM thus seems to be an ideal tool for decision making processes in hospital management. Given this background, it is surprising that so far the role of EBM in the hospital setting has been less discussed than its application in other fields of health care delivery and policy making, such as reimbursement practices by health insurance companies or the conduct of health technology assessments. One possible explanation for this is that EBM is still a relatively new movement, and in some countries is only now becoming an integral part of the definition of health care standards, including those of the hospital. 4 Clearly, however, EBM has the potential to play an increasingly important role in the shaping and structuring of hospital health care", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

Therefore it is crucial to observe and critically analyse the implementation of EBM now, as it is taking place in the hospital setting, in order to anticipate and try to avoid ethical pitfalls as further developments occur. The hospital management’s position is extremely sensitive. Its multiple responsibilities open up the possibility for numerous conflicts between the various tasks—for example, between the need to respect the medical staff’s autonomy in therapeutic decisions and the need for efficient use of the funding provided by the community. In addition, there is a large potential for conflict between the hospital management and other stakeholders, particularly physicians, policy makers, insurers, and the pharmaceutical industry", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 13, "text": ". What role can EBM play in such conflicts? In a tertiary care setting, for example, EBM could be used by the director of the oncology department as an argument to persuade the hospital management to allow more funding for the introduction of a costly new therapy, which has been shown to increase survival time for metastasised breast cancer. On the other hand, where there is no proof of the effectiveness of a therapy, the hospital management could cite the lack of an appropriate evidence base as a reason for the hospital to refuse to provide that therapy. It could also be used to weed out effective, but relatively costly, therapeutic options. And finally, EBM could be used by insurance companies to refuse reimbursement for medical services which have a low proven effectiveness, but are in high demand by patients—for example, an alternative medicine approach", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

Just how and for whose benefits EBM is being employed and with what ethical implications can be understood only within the concrete context of a health care setting. 5 In the next part of the paper, the German hospital care situation will be used as an example to illustrate possible forms of interaction between EBM and hospital management. DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES, DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS, AND CLINICAL PATHWAYS—DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GERMAN HOSPITAL SYSTEM In order to explore the use of EBM in current developments in hospital management, the case of Germany could be of particular interest because major changes—which some have called the greatest since Bismarck’s social security act in the 19th century—are currently under way", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

Since the year 2000, EBM has explicitly been introduced into this code. 1137(e) ties evidence based guidelines into the German legislation as part of a project to reform and improve the public health system. For this purpose, a coordination committee has been established which has the task of selecting each year at least 10, mostly chronic, diseases for which there is unsatisfactory medical provision, in order to improve the quality of health care according to evidence based guidelines for these targeted diseases. The aim is to replace costly hospital treatments with standardised ambulatory treatment programmes, using specially trained physicians. These so called disease management programmes (DMPs) are now being established for diabetes, coronary heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, arterial hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The basic idea is that health insurance companies put EBM and hospital management 137 www.jmedethics.com", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

Thus health policy makers hope to give insurance companies incentives to compete for chronically ill members. As was expected, the introduction of these programmes has triggered a substantial debate between physicians, patients’ advocates, and insurance companies", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_id": 18, "text": ". The introduction of these programmes means that third parties—that is, the insurers—will gain considerable power in determining medical care for patients who are covered by these programmes. Family doctors will act as ‘‘disease managers’’ and gatekeepers for the chronically ill patients, and will probably reduce their access to tertiary health care—that is, treatment and medical advice in highly specialised hospitals. It remains to be seen how EBM will be employed in the development of these programmes— whether it will be in an impartial or a selective manner. Another important change concerns hospital payment systems, which will be changed from a fee for hospital day to a fee for a case, a reimbursement system based on the principle: ‘‘same prize for same product’’. The Australian ARDRG system (Australian refined diagnosis related groups system) is to be used as the basis for calculating hospital budgets", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

The Australian ARDRG system (Australian refined diagnosis related groups system) is to be used as the basis for calculating hospital budgets. Under very great time pressure, this system is currently scheduled to be adapted to German conditions in a period of time so short as to be unprecedented. Hospitals could have started on 1 January 2003 on a voluntary basis, but all must start in 2004. After an adaptation period of only three years, this system will come into full economic use. 9 In a peculiarly perfectionist manner, the Australian DRGs are being converted to German DRGs. Even though Germany has no experience with this payment system, it is the first country in the world to plan to calculate hospital budgets completely on a DRG basis.

Tertiary hospitals with a high level of medical services, especially university hospitals and emergency departments with intensive care units, are faced with the likelihood of significant budget reductions due to a high percentage of cost intensive medical treatments. This could have a negative impact on both the level of medical services and/or on the extent of innovation. In this situation the following factors are discussed as being significant for a hospital’s survival: optimal documentation of diagnoses and procedures by physicians; high quality of services and products; minimal duration of hospital stays; a product portfolio defined by economic aspects; and, in particular, efficiency in resource utilisation. One possible way to optimise resource utilisation is to define clinical pathways. These should, as some authors suggested, be evidence based", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

These should, as some authors suggested, be evidence based. 10 Given, however, that the minimum quality standards for medical services for any of the 800 DRGs are not currently defined, there is significant concern that economic aspects may play a greater role than the conclusions of EBM, at least during the system’s introductory period. All hospitals will seek the best way to survive economically. Some health insurance companies, too, seem to be more concerned with defining groups of diseases not to be treated in a hospital than with setting quality standards—for example, by participating in therapy optimisation studies. Eventually the critical observation that EBM may be used by some interest groups as an opportunity to cut costs rather than as an instrument to enhance quality standards in health care may be proved correct", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

Many of them hesitate to participate in working groups which could define such processes. The high daily workload may be one reason. In addition, many physicians still regard medicine to be a special ‘‘art’’, which hinders the acceptance of standardised and fixed regulations in the medical treatment process. 12 The more than 1300 published German official medical guidelines13 usually assure so called medical freedom, and most of these guidelines contain numerous diagnostic and therapeutic options that often lack scientific validation. Such general medical guidelines are not, however, suitable for increasing efficiency in a hospital or a hospital department.

They should meet the requirements of workflow management and be supported by adequate data processing. Ideally these pathways would be evidence based clinical practice guidelines, whose consistency could be reviewed according to the usual criteria: validity; strength of evidence and estimated outcomes; reliability/reproducibility; clinical applicability; clinical flexibility; clarity; and multidisciplinary process, scheduled review, and documentation", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE USE OF EBM IN HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT The developments described above are characterised by the following main features: economic pressure; competition between hospitals; the growing influence of insurance companies and the predominant concern with economic over quality aspects as demonstrated by some of them; and the resistance of the medical staff to stringent guidelines that curtail their therapeutic freedom. From this background it seems likely that EBM will be employed in a confrontational manner by various antagonists, and not in an ideal, harmonious health care system, as is sometimes projected when the advantages of EBM are portrayed. The following applications can be projected", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2004_EBM_Hospital_Management_Ethics.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_id": 25, "text": ". The following applications can be projected. First, EBM will most likely be used for the purposes of rationalising as well as rationing resources, by policy makers, insurance companies, and also by hospital managers who have to see that their institutions remain competitive. An example of cost cutting with reference to EBM is the strategy of the German Red Cross hospital in Berlin in 1997. The hospital management were instructed to reduce costs by 10%. According to a report from two participating hospital managers, this goal was achieved via economic side effects of the implementation of EBM into medical practice, such as standard operating procedures and clinical pathways. 15 Secondly, EBM will rather be used to block than to encourage innovative technologies. Evidence for the clinical efficacy of new therapeutic and diagnostic procedures can only be produced by large, randomised, double blind multicentre studies, which take a great deal of time", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

Thirdly, the management of an increasing group of patients will be predetermined by disease management programmes; the reimbursement of their care will be the basis of the corresponding diagnosis related group. It is likely that therapy will become more streamlined, a process that will be endorsed by stringent guidelines, probably to the dismay of clinicians and patients.

It can be anticipated, for example that the methodological standards of EBM, in particular the so called gold standard of randomised controlled trials, will disadvantage areas of medicine such as psychotherapy and promote biotechnical and pharmacological interventions. 17 This may lead to selective discrimination against mentally ill patients regarding their access to health care. These concerns need to be substantiated by further empirical work. Other projects, such as the introduction of DRGs for the reimbursement of medical services, have led in other countries, as in the case of US Medicare patients, to problematic ethical outcomes at the level of microallocation as well as at the level of medical infrastructure.

So far, however, there has been no adequate professional discussion of these issues.

California’s medical board has set clear standards for physician conduct which could be regarded as significant for everyone working under economically driven tendencies in health policy: The relationship between a physician and a patient must be inviolable. Included among the elements of such a relationship of trust are open and honest communication, including disclosure of all information necessary for the patient to be an informed participant in her/his care. This relationship is not to be constrained or adversely affected by any consideration other than what is best for the patient. The existence of other considerations, including financial or contractual concerns, is, and must be, secondary to the fundamental relationship. 19 It might be of help if established ethical codes like the AHA code explicitly acknowledged and addressed ethical challenges in hospital management that are due to the increasing use of EBM for explicit or implicit economic purposes", "year": 2004, "topics": ["evidence-based-medicine"], "category": "general"}

However, practice changes stimulated by a targeted P4P measure can have broader benefits that improve documentation and treatment delivery for both targeted and non-targeted patients.

Among patients targeted by the P4P incentive, the improvement in documentation could be attributable to the performance incentive, the EHR reminder, or both. That the effect was slight but statistically significant among P4P-targeted patients compared to non-targeted patients suggests that the financial incentive added to the effect of the EHR reminder alone.

However, we cannot determine whether this “spill-over” effect occurred in this observational study. In general, P4P programs that promote documentation improve process measures but have not demonstrated effects on quality of care or patient outcomes.23 Screening patients for tobacco use has been associated with increased treatment delivery in some settings, but increased cessation rates have not been demonstrated in prior studies.24–27 However, the evidence base linking brief clinician interventions with smoking cessation outcomes is strong 1", "year": 2013, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}
{"doc": "2013_PayForPerformance_EHR_Smoking_Documentation.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_id": 65, "text": ". Furthermore, smoking status documentation may have additional benefits in that it enables healthcare systems to implement chronic disease management or population management tools to help smokers achieve cessation outside the clinical encounter.28 We acknowledge several limitations to this study. First, we cannot exclude secular trends as an explanation for the increase in documentation in 2010. Notably, Meaningful Use standards for electronic health records were announced in 20104, which created an incentive for healthcare systems to improve documentation. However, during the time period of this study, our healthcare system was still engaged in planning activities and had not yet implemented interventions to meet the standard. Second, there may be unmeasured confounders associated with the specific insurer that a patient has", "year": 2013, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}
{"doc": "2013_PayForPerformance_EHR_Smoking_Documentation.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_id": 66, "text": ". Second, there may be unmeasured confounders associated with the specific insurer that a patient has. Insurers may be targeting their members who smoke in other ways which then prompt patients to discuss smoking with their provider or the insurers may be contacting their high volume providers to promote smoking status assessment. Third, we used electronic health records to identify patient diagnoses whereas the P4P incentive was administered with claims data. Accurate diagnoses depend on providers maintaining up to date problem lists and may be underreported in this data source. We chose to use EHR data which was readily available and also reflects the information available for clinicians deciding whether to screen patients. If patients with comorbidity were identified in administrative claims but not in our EHR data, they would have been included in our non-P4P-eligible group. This would have made our groups more similar and biased our results toward no effect", "year": 2013, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}
{"doc": "2013_PayForPerformance_EHR_Smoking_Documentation.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_id": 67, "text": ". This would have made our groups more similar and biased our results toward no effect. A fourth limitation is that the P4P mandated that smoking status be documented at the visit or at some earlier time. Whether smoking status entries from the past are still accurate is unknown. The increase in smoking status documentation also identified more never smokers than current smokers. While the utility of documenting smoking status lies in the system’s ability to identify a population of smokers who can be targeted for treatment and care management, increasing overall documentation also increases accuracy of smoking prevalence estimates and encourages healthcare system action and investment.

The combination improved smoking status documentation among all patients, although improvement was greater among patients targeted by the P4P incentive than those who were not. It appears that the P4P incentive added value beyond its’ prompting of a system-wide EHR reminder. These findings suggest that combining a P4P incentive with an EHR reminder could help healthcare systems striving for Meaningful Use goals to improve treatment for tobacco use and enable population health interventions for their patients who smoke.

Numerous studies have analysed health system responsiveness and related concepts, especially across different countries and health systems. However, fewer studies have applied the concept for the evaluation of specific healthcare delivery structures and thoroughly analysed its determinants within one country", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

The aims of this study are to assess the level of perceived health system responsiveness to patients with chronic diseases in ambulatory care in Germany and to analyse the determinants of health system responsiveness as well as its distribution across different population groups. Methods and Analysis: The target population consists of chronically ill people in Germany, with a focus on patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and/or from coronary heart disease (CHD). Data comes from two different sources: (i) cross-sectional survey data from a postal survey and ( ii) claims data from a German sickness fund. Data from both sources will be linked at an individual-level. The postal survey has the purpose of measuring perceived health system responsiveness, health related quality of life, experiences with disease management programmes (DMPs) and (subjective) socioeconomic background", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2015_HealthSystem_Responsiveness_ClaimsData_DMPs.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 91, "text": ". The claims data consists of information on (co)morbidities, service utilization, enrolment within a DMP and sociodemographic characteristics, including the type of residential area. Discussion: RAC is one of the first projects linking survey data on health system responsiveness at individual level with claims data. With this unique database, it will be possible to comprehensively analyse determinants of health system responsiveness and its relation to other aspects of health system performance assessment. The results of the project will allow German health system decision-makers to assess the performance of nonclinical aspects of healthcare delivery and their determinants in two important areas of health policy: in ambulatory and chronic disease care.

It can further be subdivided into two major categories, each composing four domains: “Respect-for-persons” through dignity, confidentiality, autonomy, and communication; and “Client-orientation” consisting of social support, prompt attention, choice of care provider, and quality of basic amenities. 1 The concept of health system responsiveness, mainly focusing on the comparison of health systems, has been used frequently in international studies, such as the Multi-Country Survey Study on Health and Responsiveness (MCSS), 2 the World Health Survey (WHS) 2002, 3 the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) 4 and the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE)", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

To allow for a thorough analysis of both aspects, the project follows two different approaches: in one study, general practitioners (GPs) and their respective patients will be surveyed; in the second, a survey is conducted of chronically ill patients in ambulatory care (GP and specialist care) and these survey data will subsequently be linked to individual level administrative claims data from a German sickness fund", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

The second study is carried out in close collaboration with the Scientific Institute of Techniker Krankenkasse for Benefit and Efficiency in Health Care (Wissenschaftliches Institut der Techniker Krankenkasse für Nutzen und Effizienz im Gesundheitswesen, WINEG). The following presentation of study design and methodology relates to the second approach. In Germany, health insurance is mandatory for all residents. In 2014, 85% of the population was covered under statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme (represented by 132 different sickness funds) and 11% were covered by substitutive private health insurance (PHI). Internationally compared, Germany spends many of its resources on health (11.4% of Gross Domestic Product [GDP] in 2012) and has low costsharing.

Insurants have access to a wide range of services and free choice of providers. 10 A particular characteristic of the German health system is also the separation between the hospital sector, in which around 2000 hospitals still concentrate on providing inpatient care, and the ambulatory care sector, in which more than 120 000 office-based physicians (the majority of them often single-handed) not only provide family medicine but also specialist care. 10 This study not only aims to assess the level of health system responsiveness to patients with chronic diseases in ambulatory care in Germany, but also to scrutinize the determinants of health system responsiveness as well as the distribution of responsiveness across different population groups. This includes analyses on (1) differences between participants and nonparticipants of disease management programmes (DMPs) for the chronically ill, (2) differences among people from different residential areas (eg, rural vs", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Analyses will be based on a unique dataset – survey data on health system responsiveness linked to individual level administrative claims data from a German sickness fund – and will thus add important new aspects to the existing literature on health system responsiveness. Methods/Design The target population of the study is chronically ill people. With the aim of having homogenous patient groups, the study is split into 2 substudies both focusing on one specific (group of) chronic condition: One substudy focuses on type 2 diabetes and the other concentrates on coronary heart disease (CHD). These conditions were chosen for 3 reasons: (1) the high prevalence rates, (2) DMPs exist for both conditions, and (3) the respective DMPs are highly utilized", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Furthermore, the survey data will be used to gain insight into the participants’ health related quality of life, their experiences with DMPs and their (subjective) socioeconomic background (see Final Instrument section).

Sample For each substudy (type 2 diabetes and CHD) we aim for a sample size of 2500 persons. Due to the planned linkage of survey and claims data, participants are not only asked to complete and return the questionnaire but to give their written informed consent for data linkage.

Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study linking survey data to health system responsiveness at individual level with SHI administrative claims data, comprising information on medical diagnoses, prescriptions of pharmaceuticals, healthcare service utilization and sociodemographic characteristics. With this unique database, we will be able to comprehensively analyse determinants of health system responsiveness and its relation to other aspects of health system performance assessment, such as health outcomes and equity. Y et, it has to be considered that, due to the nature of the data (only from one sickness fund, only specific diseases), the results from the project will not be necessarily generalizable for the German healthcare system as a whole. Nevertheless, the project will lead to new insights on the determinants of health system responsiveness, eg, with regard to service utilisation and (co) morbidities", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

In addition, it will allow German health system stewards to assess the performance of nonclinical aspects of healthcare delivery and their determinants in two important areas of health policy: in outpatient and chronic disease care. The usage and linkage of different data sources is of high potential for assessing health system performance not only in Germany but internationally. Y et, there are still various aspects in health system performance assessment where the combination of various datasets has hardly been explored or actually applied. In this study protocol we demonstrate one potential approach for using different data sources in health system performance assessment.

[3] That is: we made changes to the “prompt attention” item, as we differentiate between the waiting time in the waiting room and the waiting time from asking for an appointment until the appointment; we made slight changes in the “autonomy” item by replacing “the treatment” with “your treatment.” [4] Authors’ own translation, original wording in German.

Infrastructural deficiencies of health services are reported in literature and research. A number of instruments exist for the assessment of infrastructure. However, no easy-to-use instruments to assess health facility infrastructure in developing countries are available. Present tools are not applicable for a rapid assessment by health facility staff.

Methods: A rapid assessment tool for the infrastructure of primary health care facilities was developed by the authors and pilot-tested in Tanzania. The tool measures the quality of all infrastructural components comprehensively and with high standardization. Ratings use a 2-1-0 scheme which is frequently used in Tanzanian health care services. Infrastructural indicators and indices are obtained from the assessment and serve for reporting and tracing of interventions. The tool was pilot-tested in Tanga Region (Tanzania). Results: The pilot test covered seven primary care facilities in the range between dispensary and district hospital. The assessment encompassed the facilities as entities as well as 42 facility buildings and 80 pieces of technical medical equipment. A full assessment of facility infrastructure was undertaken by health care professionals while the rapid assessment was performed by facility staff.

Conclusions: The authors recommend integrating the rapid assessment tool in the health information systems of developing countries. Health authorities in a decentralized health system are thus enabled to detect infrastructural deficiencies and trace the effects of interventions.

It is obvious that qualified and motivated personnel are crucial for preventive and curative medical services, and vaccines as well as drugs are of utmost importance for the health of people. However, the role of health care facility infrastructure as a major component of a health care system must not be underestimated. For instance, the WHO Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research defines six building blocks of health care systems, the infrastructure constituting one component of the building block “service delivery ” [2]. The term ‘infrastructure’ is used in manifold ways to describe the structural elements of systems. In the context of a health care system and in reference to health care facilities, we defined “facility infrastructure ” as the total of all physical, technical and organizational components or assets that are prerequisites for the delivery of health care services", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

For instance, maintenance of infrastructure frequently constitutes a problem in resource poor countries [11]. It is frequently neglected due to lack of funds, availability of spare parts, poor training or little availability of maintenance personnel and a culture disregarding maintenance. Consequently, the condition of assets is often rather poor and contributes to the low structural quality of health care services [12]. This calls for a higher managerial awareness of infrastructure. Although the relevance of health facility infrastructure for the health care quality is obvious, the literature on health care facility infrastructure is limited.

Assessment of health care infrastructure A recent and rather comprehensive study on health care infrastructure was presented by Hsia et al. [13]. They evaluated six infrastructural key components of hospitals and health centres in African sub-Saharan countries under the aspect of access to surgical and emergency care", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

The study describes “…dramatic deficiencies in infrastructure [ …] in all countries studied ” [13]. An older evaluation of the health care infrastructure of 16 Lutheran hospitals in T anzania done by Flessa [14] came to the same results. However, health policy decision-making cannot be based on snap-shot like research. Instead, routine data must be gathered within the existing Health Information Systems (HIS) [15-18]. Many developing countries currently implement the roll-out of a contemporary software-based HIS which includes epidemiological and demographic data. The majority of health data are gathered at the level of health care facilities. Data collection is performed by medical or administrative staff of the health care facilities in a monthly, quarterly or yearly routine. However, health information systems are reported to function insufficiently [16,19]", "year": 2015, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Furthermore, infrastructural components are only partly assessed even in recently developed tools like ‘Service Availability and Readiness Assessment’ (SARA) [20]. Assessments consider such components only to a minor extent in existing health information systems like MTUHA in Tanzania. A reliable and sustainable health care facility infrastructure assessment tool must fulfil the following seven criteria: Firstly, a thorough collection of infrastructural data must cover all seven components of infrastructure Figure 1 Health care facility infrastructure – major components.

These criteria which were derived from the desired function of the tool are in line with Rogers ’ research on the diffusion of innovations [21]. Rogers emphasizes the importance of the perception of an innovation by the members of the respective social system. According to his research, the compatibility of an innovation is positively related to its rate of adoption, while complexity has the contrary effect. While various internal stakeholders of a health system [14] are involved in the use of an innovative assessment tool on facility infrastructure, the authors ’ reflection of compatibility and complexity criteria primarily focussed on the first-line users i.e. the health care facility staff.

The implications of ratings are: /C152: very good or good condition; therefore no need of action; /C151: minor problems; therefore need of action, but not immediate; /C150: major problems or hazards; therefore need of immediate action.

Wherever applicable, data of the ‘information-type’ are transformed to ratings in the analysis of the assessment data according to defined standards. To give an example for such standards, dispensaries are expected to offer services 5 days per week (the datum ‘5 days ’ is transformed to the rating ‘2’ for the calculation of the ‘accessibility indicator ’).

Abstract Introduction: This article presents the scientific evidence for the merits of telemedicine interventions in primary care. Although there is no uniform and consistent definition of primary care, most agree that it occupies a central role in the healthcare system as first contact for patients seeking care, as well as gatekeeper and coordinator of care. It enables and supports patient-centered care, the medical home, managed care, accountable care, and population health. Increasing concerns about sustainability and the anticipated shortages of primary care physicians have sparked interest in exploring the potential of telemedicine in addressing many of the challenges facing primary care in the United States and the world.Materials and Methods:The findings are based on a systematic review of scientific studies published from 2005 through 2015.

Evidence is organized and evaluated according to feasibility/acceptance, intermediate outcomes, health outcomes, and cost.Results: The majority of studies support the feasibility/acceptance of telemedicine for use in primary care, although it varies significantly by demographic variables, such as gender, age, and socioeconomic status, and telemedicine has often been found more acceptable by patients than healthcare providers. Outcomes data are limited but overall suggest that telemedicine interventions are generally at least as effective as traditional care. Cost analyses vary, but telemedicine in primary care is increasingly demonstrated to be cost-effective.

Whereas the previous articles were focused on well-defined disease entities served by one or more medical specialties and subspecialties, this article focuses on a form of medical care practice provided by a group of physicians that encompasses all aspects of healthcare delivery, but one with a somewhat amorphous content and with imprecise and shifting boundaries. Although the topical areas chosen as the focal points for the previous articles were quite complex in and of themselves, each with various manifestations, it was relatively straightforward to explain what they are and to provide basic information regarding their etiology, epidemiology, and cost. This information was deemed as appropriate context for the review and analysis of the empirical evidence regarding the impact of telemedicine interventions in those domains. Here, we focus on primary care, an inclusive concept that refers to a more general practice of medicine compared with practice that is more narrowly focused", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

PRIMARY CARE: ORIGIN, RATIONALE, AND SCOPE The origin of the term primary care can be traced to the 1920 Dawson Report by Lord Bertrand Dawson, 9 which designated primary health centers as the cornerstone of a proposed regional health system for the United Kingdom. ‘‘The distinguishing features of these Primary Health Centres, in contradistinction to Secondary Health Centres, would be that they would be staffed by general practitioners.’’ Although the Report was immediately shelved by the U.K", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

However, it should be noted that the British health system differs in some fundamental ways from that of the United States, reflecting both its much older roots (the definition of the British ‘‘physician’’ goes back to the early years of the 16th Century) and the much smaller and more densely populated land area. Unlike in the United States, ‘‘general practitioners’’ (GPs) in the British system not only treat a wide range of ailments but also do not see patients in hospitals. In the United States, well into the first half of the 20th Century, specialization was distinctly unusual, and most healthcare was delivered by GPs", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

In the United States, well into the first half of the 20th Century, specialization was distinctly unusual, and most healthcare was delivered by GPs. After the Second World War, the numbers of physicians who chose to enter specialty training increased rapidly, along with increasing numbers of physicians choosing to sit for specialty board examinations. Shortly after the passage of the Amendments to the Social Security Act of 1965 (Title 18 and Title 19), the privately sponsored and widely distributed report by Folsom 10 declared that ‘‘ .every individual should have a personal physician, and funds must be made available to support this goal.’’ Implicit in this conclusion was the idea that for most people their personal physician should be a primary care physician", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

At the time, there was a concern about a growing trend toward increased specialization in medicine at the expense of primary care, which could result in limiting access to care, a trend that persisted, if not accelerated, over the ensuing years. The American Medical Association–sponsored Citizens Commission on Graduate Medical Education report by Mills et al. 11 (published in 1966) suggested the presence of ‘‘ .a kind of arrogance in specialized medicine’’ and stressed the need for a new body of knowledge to guide the work of ‘‘primary physicians.’’12 They saw this as a difficult and costly change that would require a radical departure from past practice.

In the late 1960s, some hoped that Family Practice would become the main primary care discipline, would have a well-accepted role in medical training, and would eventually represent 25% of all U.S. residency positions. 18 Others saw Pediatrics and Internal Medicine as continuing to play a major role in the delivery of primary care", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

At any rate, 40 years later, Family Medicine continues to be one of many primary care specialties, including General Internal Medicine, Internal Medicine/ Pediatrics, and General Pediatrics. Before the age of medical specialization, all medical practice was in the primary care domain. Specialization emerged as a result of several factors, including the following: (1) changes in science and technology, as well as the expanding knowledge base; (2) the attendant requirement for prolonged education and training, with (2a) the creation of a system for defining specialties and (2b) the utilization of specialty training as a tool for assigning different levels of reimbursement; (3) the development of the modern hospital as a hub for advanced medical treatment, surgery, and training; and (4) professional control over standards and certification", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

Nonetheless, the distinction between primary and specialty care may be arbitrary because the scope of primary care is continuous, and it is normally aimed at the full range of health services ranging from the prevention of disease and the promotion of health, the delivery of clinical services for the sick and the infirm, the amelioration of pain and disability, and when all else fails assisting in a graceful and humane end of life. In many instances, both primary care providers (PCPs) and specialist providers are simultaneously involved in caring for patients, particularly those with chronic diseases and serious illnesses. Moreover, the boundaries between primary and specialty care are constantly changing, and what was once specialized care may over time become routine.

In addition, some have attributed other related functions such as familiarity with medical history, family, and community, meeting the needs of the whole person in a sustained relationship, continuity of care, and referral to specialists and hospitalization. 19 In this role, the PCP is expected to deliver comprehensive care for many common ailments. 2. Gatekeeper. As the division between primary and specialty care has changed, there was a concern that patients’ selfreferring to specialists would lead to inappropriate referrals as well as increased cost.

Renal physicians, for example, coordinate a very complex set of services, including dialysis, preparations for transplant, balancing electrolytes, and vascular access. Currently, care for chronic illness ‘‘is subpar regardless of the specialty of the caregiver,’’ especially in complex cases.22 Successful interventions tend to be complex involving changes in clinician behavior, practice organization, information systems, and educational programs aimed at patients", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

In 2010, an estimated 6–7% of Medicare spending went to primary care. If the current amount were nearly doubled to 10–12% of total healthcare funding, it has been estimated that the increase would be cost-neutral, with resulting reduction in overall health spending. 41 In 2015, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicated a commitment to change from volume-based to value-based payment", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

Part of the difficulty had to do with the lack of a precise definition of the content of primary care because the boundaries between primary and specialty care are often blurry, possibly overlapping and changing. For example, a classical telemedicine consultation between a GP and a specialist is typically initiated when the GP is seeking an expert opinion regarding a patient in her or his practice. So although the care is provided in a primary care setting, the remote specialist is engaged to render an opinion regarding diagnosis and/or treatment. In some instances, the advice is to transfer the patient to a tertiary-care center where appropriate treatment/ intervention is available. Ultimately, the patient is referred back to the PCP for follow-up and ongoing care", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

Hence, in some instances we used an arbitrary rule to exclude certain studies from this analysis when they did not embody clear demarcation lines between primary and specialty care, and the focus is mostly on specialty care. In addition, there was no consensus on the precise context and scope of the telemedicine intervention in primary care. Here, we probably erred on the side of including a broader variety of studies that investigated the effectiveness of electronic reminders, text messaging between patient and provider, and electronic visits (e-visits) (direct-to-consumer services). Also, because primary care is not disease-specific, we included studies that investigated the effects of telemedicine on clinic attendance (or no show rates), afterhour-care patients, and compliance with prescribed medical regimen and medications", "year": 2016, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

An outlier was defined as incurring costs exceeding the 75th percentile during a 6-month period after the index visit (which could be either online or in-person). A logistic regression adjusted for differences between the intervention and control groups. The percentages of cost outliers in the two groups were 21.2% and 28.5%, respectively. Median standard costs were $161 for online visits and $219 for same-day acute visits. The adjusted odds for being a cost outlier was substantially lower for the online group than for the standard visit group (odds ratio = 0.52).

Reviewing the use of telemedicine poses challenges analogous to reviewing primary care in general—in that both are rapidly changing. Just as the meaning of primary care is constantly being redefined, so too are the capabilities of telemedicine, for patients, physicians, and health systems. Indeed, although it is impossible accurately to predict what new tools will become available over the next few decades, it seems reasonable to predict that substantial advances in information and communication technology and related fields would enable doctors and patients to interact with each other and among themselves in ever more efficient and effective devices and platforms, not now feasible. This trend will continue and accelerate.

This raises the obvious question regarding the generality of evidence gathered in different socioeconomic contexts, or if there are different national styles in the use of telemedicine.

On Digitization and Health Information Systems Digitization has meanwhile become a priority for governments and societies (e.g. [1, 2] for Germany). In the context of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals it is mentioned that the “spread of information and communications technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide and to develop knowledge societies, as does scientific and technological innovation across areas as diverse as medicine and energy” [3]", "year": 2018, "topics": ["health-information-systems", "medical-informatics"], "category": "health-informatics"}
{"doc": "2018_German_Medical_Informatics_Initiative_HealthIS.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 441, "text": ". Health care and biomedical research in this new information age is affected in many ways (e.g. [4, 5, 6, 7]). According to the World Health Organization, information and communication technologies for health are “recognised as one of the most rapidly growing areas in health today” [8]. Health information systems in this context play an important role. They have developed significantly during the last decades. As examples, for the 1980ies [9], the seminal paper of Peter Reichertz on this topic is mentioned here, also [10] and [11] for the first decade of the 21st century ([11] directly referring to [9]), as well as [12] and [13] for current reflections. As outlined in [14], the trend from institution-centered (e.g. hospital-centered) information processing for health care to information processing, supporting patient-centered care beyond one health care institution has already been mentioned in [11], section 3.2 (see also figure 6 on p. 277, line 2)", "year": 2018, "topics": ["health-information-systems", "medical-informatics"], "category": "health-informatics"}
{"doc": "2018_German_Medical_Informatics_Initiative_HealthIS.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 442, "text": ". 277, line 2). It was there as well mentioned that health information systems should support both patient care and biomedical research ([11], section 3.4, see also figure 6 on p. 277, line 4). In spite of this progress during the last decades, there is still a significant need for improving health information systems’ architectures and functionalities, in particular for the benefit of patients as well as for the progress of biomedical/health sciences and of computer/information sciences. 2.

When planning this Focus Theme with consortia’s leading medical informatics colleagues and with the journal’s Editor- in-Chief, we were aware of the fact that reporting about the German Medical Informatics Initiative at this early stage cannot contain results and has to focus on presenting concepts and plans. As it is a large national experiment on an important topic, we are convinced that communicating on these concepts and plans to an international audience is of importance. Choosing for publication Methods Open, the Gold Open Access part of Methods of Information in Medicine, makes the manuscript of this Focus Theme immediately broadly available in a fair way through the journal’s tandem model ([21], p. 484)", "year": 2018, "topics": ["health-information-systems", "medical-informatics"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Will the German Medical Informatics Initiative push health information systems from the current present state to a new future state? Will this progress be for the benefit of patients as well as for the progress of biomedical/health sciences and of computer/information sciences? Will progress be mainly limited to Germany or will it have an international impact? Answers to all these questions will hopefully be given in the future, after the German Medical Informatics Initiative’s development and networking phase or even later. References 1.

PCORNet has substantial potential to support learning health systems in rapidly evaluating these programs, but access to complete patient data on health care utilization is limited as PCORNet is based on electronic health records not health insurance claims data. Because matching cases to comparison patients on baseline utilization is often a critical component of high-quality observational comparative effectiveness research for high-need high-cost patients, limited access to claims may negatively affect the quality of the matching process", "year": 2019, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}
{"doc": "2019_Claims_EHR_CaseManagement_Healthcare_Systems.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 460, "text": ". We sought to determine whether the evaluation of programs for high-need high-cost patients required claims data to match cases to comparison patients. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study design with multiple measures of before-and-after health care utilization for 1935 case management patients and 3833 matched comparison patients aged 18 years and older from 2011 to 2015. EHR and claims data were extracted from 3 health systems participating in PCORNet. Results: Without matching on claims-based health care utilization, the case management programs at 2 of 3 health systems were associated with fewer hospital admissions and emergency visits over the subsequent 12 months. With matching on claims-based health care utilization, case management was no longer associated with admissions and emergency visits at those 2 programs", "year": 2019, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Key words: learning health systems, case management, health care administrative claims, electronic health records, comparative effectiveness research INTRODUCTION Caring for high-need, high-cost patients is an urgent priority within American health care delivery. 1 With the national shift to valuebased payment, programs to improve quality and reduce costs for patients with complex needs are now spreading rapidly among health systems, even though recent reviews suggest little evidence of overall cost savings. 2,3 Because existing models of case management vary widely in the details of design, implementation, and effectiveness, 2,4 many health systems have moved forward in implementing these programs without clear guidance", "year": 2019, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}
{"doc": "2019_Claims_EHR_CaseManagement_Healthcare_Systems.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 463, "text": ". These health systems often customize a program to their local setting and resources and may select only some program components, potentially reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of the original program. 2 Given the high cost of case management programs, there is a critical need to evaluate programs adapted within health systems to ensure that effectiveness is maintained. This requires the rapid generation and application of knowledge—in essence, a “rapid-learning health system.” 5 Learning health systems access and apply evidence from research while simultaneously learning from their own processes of delivering care. However, there are significant practical challenges to routine evaluation of effectiveness by health systems, including a lack of evaluation capacity and barriers related to data and information technology (IT) infrastructure", "year": 2019, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}

OBJECTIVES To examine the importance of access to complete claims data in rapidly evaluating care for high-need high-cost patients, we sought to determine whether the evaluation of case management programs required the use of claims data to match cases to comparison patients or whether EHR-based matching was sufficient. Specifically, we used both an EHR-based matching strategy and an EHR/claimsbased matching strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of different outpatient case management programs, compared to usual care, in preventing hospital admissions and emergency visits across 3 health systems using PCORNet-facilitated EHR data combined with local claims data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Overview We partnered with 3 academic health systems to obtain PCORNetfacilitated EHR data and local claims data. To determine whether evaluation of case management programs required the use of claims data to match cases to comparison patients, we conducted EHRbased matching for each of the 3 systems and EHR/claims-based matching for 2 of the 3 systems ( Figure 1 ). To create matched cohorts, we created a 1-year baseline episode for each case management patient and then created multiple 1-year baseline episodes for potential comparison patients. After exclusions were applied, we matched the baseline episode for the eligible cases to the bestmatched baseline episodes for /C24 2 comparison patients. Once these 5 matched cohorts were created (3 EHR-based cohorts and 2 EHR/ claims-based cohorts), we used a retrospective cohort study design with multiple before-and-after measures of the outcome for each case management patient and their matched comparison patients", "year": 2019, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}

This claims-enhanced matching on baseline outcome measures improved performance, consistent with previous literature. 16 Matching is often considered a superior approach because it does not require the strict assumptions necessary for statistical adjustment. 26,27,30 Established case management programs are often complex and difficult to implement as a whole,1 and health systems often select only some program components which could potentially compromise program effectiveness", "year": 2019, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Our evaluations allow each health system to learn from its own processes of delivering care 5 and supports each health system in making changes to ensure the effectiveness of its programs.

It is difficult to envision a large randomized study sufficiently powered to examine all possible combinations of relevant key factors. For interventions such as case management programs that are spreading rapidly despite a paucity of evidence, rigorous observational studies may be able to contribute more rapidly to the knowledge base. 15,34 In this study, we were able to develop a standardized matching and analytic approach to evaluate case management programs at 2 of 3 sites; applying such an approach more broadly, coupled with data on program characteristics, would provide important information on the characteristics of successful programs", "year": 2019, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}

This future work could be enhanced through innovations, such as indices of fidelity to possible intervention core components, to identify the active ingredients of programs. 35 In addition, rather than focusing on average effects, future research should consider evaluating heterogeneity in treatment effects 36 that would accommodate different responsiveness to case management within population subgroups. Our study has additional limitations. We only followed outcomes for 1 year after enrollment into the case management program. It has been suggested tha t it takes time to realize positive outcomes from ca se management in prim ary care, and that 12 months is too short to draw conclusions. 32 In 1 study, negative results with respect to emergency visits at 12 months turned into positive results at 24 months. 37 In addition, we were limited to evaluating case management programs in large health systems affiliated with academic medical centers", "year": 2019, "topics": ["ehr"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Institutionalizing effective, sustainable community health systems is currently limited by a lack of standard metrics for measuring CHW performance and the systems they work within. Developed through iterative consultations, supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and in partnership with USAID and UNICEF, this paper details a framework, list of indicators, and measurement considerations for monitoring CHW performance in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: A review of peer-reviewed articles, reports, and global data collection tools was conducted to identify key measurement domains in monitoring CHW performance. Three consultations were successively convened with global stakeholders, community health implementers, advocates, measurement experts, and Ministry of Health representatives using a modified Delphi approach to build consensus on priority indicators", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

During this process, a structured, web-based survey was administered to identify the importance and value of specific measurement domains, sub-domains, and indicators determined through the literature reviews and initial stakeholder consultations. Indicators with more than 75% support from participants were further refined with expert qualitative input. Results: Twenty-one sub-domains for measurement were identified including measurement of incentives for CHWs, supervision and performance appraisal, data use, data reporting, service delivery, quality of services, CHW absenteeism and attrition, community use of services, experience of services, referral/counter-referral, credibility/ trust, and programmatic costs. Forty-six indicators were agreed upon to measure the sub-domains. In the absence of complete population enumeration and digitized health information systems, the quality of metrics to monitor CHW programs is limited.

The 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Alma-Ata was a global call to re-invigorate efforts to achieve health for all through strengthening PHC systems [ 2, 3]. Mounting evidence since 1978 in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) has shown that focusing on provision of health services at the community level not only leads to more efficient and equitable use of health resources and better health outcomes [4], but also is a consistent component of strong, effective health systems", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2019_CommunityHealthWorkforce_Performance_PrimaryCare_Systems.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 522, "text": ". Since Alma-Ata, community health worker (CHW) programs in LMICs have been promoted to strengthen broad-based health efforts within community settings. CHWs, who for the purposes of this paper, refer to frontline health workers with up to 6 months of initial training, serve as the first point of contact for community members, especially for individuals living in low-income or rural communities whose access to facility-based health care may be limited. Often as community members themselves, CHWs possess a unique understanding of the local context, including barriers and facilitators to accessing timely and quality PHC, and can facilitate the most effective linkages to care. Despite decades of interest and renewed commitment to expand Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by scaling up CHW programs, a universal, standardized system for empirically measuring the effectiveness of CHW programs does not yet exist [ 5–7]", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Measurement is limited by the lack of an accepted and pragmatic set of theoretically grounded and validated indicators [ 8]. The integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) Framework was an attempt to provide guidance on measurement and metrics of iCCM programs; however, it has few metrics measured at the community level [ 9]. There is a need for consensus on measuring CHWs ’ performance as a part of the larger community health system, broadly defined as “set of local actors, relationships, and processes engaged in producing, advocating for, and supporting health in communities and households outside of, but existing in relationship to, formal health structures” [10–13]", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2019_CommunityHealthWorkforce_Performance_PrimaryCare_Systems.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 524, "text": ". In practice, community health systems may include the enabling environment in which CHWs work, including household-level caregivers, other formal and informal healthcare providers, organizational intermediaries including non-governmental and faith-based organization s, other government sectors such as housing and education, among others [ 11]. As the link between individuals, communities, and health facilities, CHWs must be fluent in navigating the formal, facilitybased health system, while maintaining their relationships within the community where they work [ 11, 14]. Consequently, the measurement of CHW performance needs to account for not only the activities of the CHW, but also those of the community health system that support the CHW. Experts have called for the recognition of the community health system as its own, unique sub-system of the health system, articulating a need to standardize the way performance and success of this sub-system is measured [11]", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

This information was abstracted and consolidated to inform the measurement domains for the framework. At first, the review was aimed at identifying a framework in the existing literature that would comprehensively identify priority metrics for measuring CHW programs, instead of developing a new framework. We identified 34 frameworks (Box 1) that peripherally addressed this objective, including but not limited to the CHW Assessment and Improvement Matrix (CHW AIM) [18], CHW logic model proposed by Naimoli et al [ 6], USAID Community Health Framework [ 19], and the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) conceptual framework [20].

Given this, a new framework was proposed that leverages these existing frameworks and is pragmatically geared towards monitoring community health worker programs. The review of literature and existing frameworks helped identify and define sub-domains of a draft Community Health Worker Performance Measurement Framework. This was refined further based on a series of consultations as described below (Fig. 1). Concept development Four critical considerations guided the development of the framework: 1. Measurement of CHW performance should consider system-level processes including the role of governance, policy, internal and external investments, and other supportive mechanisms, and account for the broader community health system that influences CHW program performance. 2. In countries without centralized coordination, NGOs typically play an outsized role in implementation of CHW programs, with divergent CHW roles, responsibilities, and timelines", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

To account for this variation, we recommend the use of existing standardized metrics (e.g., for iCCM, HIV, TB, family planning, maternal health) to measure downstream impacts of services on a specific outcome area. 3. While several factors contribute to the success of CHW programs, the proposed indicators around the framework focus on aspects that are amenable to and critical for the purposes of measurement of CHW performance. For multidimensional and critical concepts such as community empowerment and job satisfaction, formative work is currently being undertaken by the Population Council within the Frontline Health project to develop scale-based metrics. 4.

CHW performance appraisal and feedback from supervisors are key components of quality supervision and require assessment as well, possibly in a non-routine study. Alternately, digital and mobile job aids with algorithms and behavioral analytics could help operationalize quality assessments and provide remote supervision. The Perceived Supervision Scale (PSS) is a six-item scale that captures regular contact, two-way communication as well as joint-problem-solving, and has been validated in six countries [54]. We recommend the use and refinement of this measure across different contexts or, alternately, testing a modified PSS such that it captures elements of perceived value of CHW supervision, and the content and alignment of the supervisory visit with protocols", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

If data are being routinely collected and reported, it does not automatically imply that they are being used for decision-making. Assessment of data use may require special cross-sectional and ethnographic studies, to understand whether data are being used for decisionmaking and assess reasons for data use/disuse behaviors. Inclusion of this metric in the framework also highlights the need to have management structures in place such that those that are collecting the data, especially client data, also have access to that information [ 46].

Recruitment: Several aspects of measurement of CHW recruitment are important, including understanding how many CHWs are recruited, their density per geographic area (e.g., by district, region), and disaggregating recruitment by the representation of CHWs from different types of communities (e.g., diverse ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and originating from that community, among others). At the national and sub-national levels, the number of CHWs that have been recruited need to be monitored for fiscal planning and ensuring adequate coverage. From a measurement perspective, it is important to assess the alignment between national CHW selection policies and the actual recruitment and to recognize information systems ’ capacity to capture workforce turnover data. In some cases, education, language, or other requirements may limit recruitment of CHWs from marginalized communities [ 47]", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

In addition to the actual number of CHWs who have been recruited, it is also important to understand coverage, and quality and transparency of the recruitment process. Community participation in the recruitment process can facilitate community ownership and validation of CHWs within the communities where they work. B. Training: Initial and ongoing knowledge and skillsbased training is critical to prepare CHWs for their role in service delivery. Records on the numbers of CHWs trained are typically maintained at the program, or district level at which training occurs, and might be further aggregated at a sub-national level to assess alignment with national targets", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Maintaining training records at the program or district level can be a challenge as these trainings are often led by external NGOs who may be equally challenged by information systems limitations to feasibly transfer or maintain training data. Identifying mechanisms to consolidate the number of CHWs trained and maintaining rosters of the topic areas on which training has been received is important to scaling programs and may require additional districtlevel oversight of data management. If a national certification program exists for CHWs, tracking the number of existing and new CHWs who have completed certification is important. Finally, ensuring that measurement of training comprises not just the technical content, but also the procedures around data entry and reporting is crucial. While the number of trainings held is somewhat routinely tracked, the actual competencies of CHWs are more complex to assess", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

While the number of trainings held is somewhat routinely tracked, the actual competencies of CHWs are more complex to assess. Trainings may capture pre- and post-test knowledge scores, but efforts to assess the extent to which CHWs effectively apply their newly acquired skills are less frequently undertaken [50]. C. Incentives: While measurement of financial and non-financial incentives provided to CHWs is important, it is also a difficult area to routinely monitor. Where CHWs receive a pre-determined stipend, salary, or performance-based incentives, the receipt of these stipends might be routinely monitored through monthly/quarterly CHW or supervisor reports. Often, if CHW stipends are provided through supervisors or other personnel in the healthcare system, having routine measurement of whether the stipend was received can aid in curbing corrupt practices or mismanagement of funds", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Non-financial incentives may come in many forms—they may be institutionalized by governments in the form of educational or promotional opportunities, or by communities in the form of social recognition of the CHW [17, 53, 55]. If an institutionalized non-financial incentive exists, it might be feasible to routinely measure it. If not, programs may consider identifying and disaggr egating non-financial incentives that exist at the community level and assess them cross-sectionally. Support from community-based groups A. CHWs operate within the complex interplay of community and health systems. Engagement with and support from the communities in which they operate is critical to optimal functioning of CHWs, as also highlighted by the U.S. Government Evidence Summit [ 5, 16, 51, 56, 57].

Service delivery: The delivery of health services refers to the quantity of promotional, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative services CHWs provide to community members. Indicators under this domain pertain to the activity of the CHW, measured at the level of the individual CHW. CHW activities might be consolidated from CHW service delivery registers and routine reports.

The illustrative indicators in Table 2 may be further broken down by type of services for which the home visit was made. Note that measures of service coverage at the community level typically involve populationbased surveys and are listed under “use of services”. C. Service quality: Measurement of the quality of services provided by the CHW is perhaps one of the most critical measures to assess effectiveness of a CHW program, as historically, these programs have lost financial support when service quality does not meet required standards or varies substantially [ 59].

Unless routine quality assessment and control measures are built into supervisory activities, the measurement of service quality may require non-routine studies. When measured routinely, assessment of quality may be done through spot checks by supervisors to ascertain quality of service delivery using a checklist, or by examining client ledgers or registers. Simple checklists implemented by supervisors to observe and assess existing quality of services or community follow-up tools utilized by community members themselves may provide immediate and comprehensive feedback to the CHW. If conducted as a non-routine study, assessment of quality at the community level poses logistical challenges that are not typically experienced when assessing quality at the facility level, where direct observation of client-provider interaction and exit interviews are the normative methods for quality assessment", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Measures of CHW service quality should be tailored to specific CHW programs developed around a menu of potential service delivery priority areas. One indicator that is a common measure of quality is the timeliness of service receipt (from the first onset of symptoms). D. Data reporting: Refers to the regularity and completeness, including data validity and verification, of reporting on the services CHWs provide at the community or household level [60]. The level of data reporting can skew our understanding of all other progress measures—plausibly CHWs who are more active in their communities are also reporting more regularly and accurately.

Absenteeism: Refers to the frequency with which CHWs are absent from their routine responsibilities. In settings where CHWs are volunteers or part-time employees, a regular schedule of activities may not exist [ 61]. This makes assessment of absenteeism challenging. If CHWs are reporting on their activities with some level of regularity, that might be a proxy measure for their regularity in their roles as Agarwal et al.

Motivation: Refers to intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence CHWs ’ interest in and willingness to perform their jobs. The challenge of measuring motivation through specific indicators stems from its latency and multidimensionality as a construct and demands a scale-based approach. Motivation dimensions previously measured in community and primary health care settings include inertia towards one’s job; external financial rewards; self-worth contingencies including recognition from communities, supervisors, and colleagues; accepting the value of the job; internalizing the job ’s value into one ’s sense of self; and performing an activity for its own sake [ 62–64].

Job satisfaction: Refers to a latent construct that captures a CHW ’s sense of his or her ability to perform his or her job in a particular work climate [65]. Similar to motivation, job satisfaction is best suited to measurement using a scale-based approach that aggregates the attributes of a CHW ’s job, including the job design and shared/ participatory decision-making, empowerment, timeliness of decision implementation, availability of material supportive aides, support by communities in which they work, adequate feedback, recognition, management by supervisors, and mutual trust and cooperation among peers", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

C. Attrition/retention: In comparison to absenteeism, measurement of attrition aims to capture the proportion of practicing CHWs who resign, retire, or abandon their positions. Given that CHWs may be volunteers, and their “employment” may often not be captured in official rosters, prolonged inactivity may be considered a proxy for attrition, where “prolonged” is a standard length of time determined at the country level, e.g., 1 month, 3 months [ 47].

Use of services: Community-level use of services is typically measured through population-based surveys. To the extent possible, these indicators should be aligned with extant national surveys that already capture indicators specific to CHW services. For example, the DHS measures the percentage of pregnant/recently delivered women who were visited by a CHW in the last 12 months, as well as several other health-area-specific indicators focused on use of services offered by CHWs. Table 3 presents a list of these indicators based on extant surveys.

Knowledge of service availability: Understanding the degree to which the community is aware of the presence and availability of a local health worker and the services they provide is critical to respond to community needs and priorities [ 5, 66]. Measuring this may require a population-based study. C. Referral/counter-referral: Timely and appropriate referral from the community to the health facility is often considered one of the key functions of CHWs. Counter-referral from the health facility back to the CHW facilitates continuity of care in the home context of the client. One of the challenges with measuring referral is identifying the appropriate denominator (i.e., no. of clients eligible for referral per protocol). Such an assessment is not feasible to undertake routinely; therefore, referral may be measured per 100 or “X” clients seen by the CHW, disaggregated by reason for referral and used for comparisons across settings or over time [ 67, 68]", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Measurement of counter-referral may only be pertinent in cases where continuity of care is recommended, as in the care of several chronic diseases. For example, if a child was referred to the facility for treatment of diarrhea, unless it is severe, there may not be a reason for counter-referral. However, if a client is referred to the health facility for suspected hypertension, counter-referral may be more appropriate. Measurement of counter-referral may also not be feasible in the absence of advanced information technology and digital systems that link facility records back to the community. Agarwal et al.

B. Experience of care: Understanding and measuring the experience of care from the client ’s perspective is critical, but complex to standardize in the context of community health systems. This construct often overlaps with service use and technical service quality for a particular health area, though offers the subjective understanding of the interaction between client ’s interactions with a CHW. Table 2 recommends that experience of care is measured through two indicators: levels of satisfaction with services received by a CHW in the last 3 months and the client perception of respectful care", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Credibility/trust of CHW: The degree to which clients consider the CHWs, and ultimately the services provided by CHWs, to be credible and reliable impacts the use of CHW services. While client trust in health information and services provided by the CHW are presented as proxy metrics in Table 2, these are not validated nor reflect the multidimensionality of trust within CHW-client relationships (includes dimensions of honesty, confidentiality, competency, and mutual respect, and partnership in health care decisionmaking processes) [ 72]", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Two primary concepts around equity of community health systems warrant discussion —first, the equitable selection and access to training and growth opportunities for CHWs themselves; second, the activities and inherent biases of the CHW and the health system differentially affect use and quality of services received by different community groups", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Disaggregation by equity-promoting variables requires a substantial commitment to advancing equity and utilizing accompanying resources. As a starting point, three levels of disaggregation, in alignment with the DHS might be considered—by wealth quintile, by level of education, and by place of residence (i.e., urban and rural) [ 75].

We note here that equity should not be misunderstood for equality — while equality deals with fairness through equal distribution of resources, equity is concerned with need-based resource allocation even if that means unequal distribution [76]. Gender (in) equity may broadly refer to gender-related barriers to CHW performance, any unique needs and protections expressed by CHWs as a result of their gender (e.g., female CHWs may have certain safety concerns in some locations), minority identity in a particular context, and power relations facing CHWs within the health system hierarchy or community governance structures [74, 77].

Measurement considerations might entail understanding the gender, ethnic, or age profiles of the cadre of CHWs and how that might affect perceptions of safety, interaction with the community and other health personnel in the health system, and overall motivation to continue working as a CHW. Beyond the need for capturing disaggregated metrics and needs of CHWs, who occupy lower positions in the health system hierarchy, it is important to consider policy-relevant metrics that support female health workers in particular, such as equitable hiring practices, uncompensated leave, sexual harassment, and discriminatory training policies [ 78]", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Given that CHWs are typically responsible for all members of the community and given the expanding scope of their responsibilities (i.e., beyond traditional RMNCH care to include aging and non-communicable disease management), gender balance of recipients of care from the CHW at the community level is also important to consider. Accountability in the context of community health systems is multifold, challenging to measure, but highly relevant in understanding how to institutionalize CHW programs and community health systems as agreed on by the TAG and literature [ 66]. It refers to the dual accountability of the CHW to the community for timely delivery of services and to the health system to perform required tasks, and to the responsiveness of the health system and communities to CHWs, namely by providing a supportive work environment, remuneration for service, and systematic feedback", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Two perspectives might be considered around the measurement of accountability: as an outcome, which could be captured by policylevel inputs (e.g., funding integration in national and sub-national budgets and protective regulation around CHW scope) and local administrative government status reports, and as a governance and health system process that includes community participation in planning and review of CHW activities. Across the framework, indicators capture the types of support, remuneration (incentives), and recognition/systematic feedback that a CHW may receive from the government, health systems, and community, as well as the benefits the community receives from the activities of the CHW. Economic evaluation Emerging health system needs involve studies on the cost of scale up, particularly returns on investment in community health systems; economic evaluation metrics specific to community health systems better enable justification of health investments at the national level", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Economic-cost-related metrics pose a challenge and require consideration of deaths or complications averted by CHW programs and comparative out-of-pocket cost savings models with respect to preventative care seeking from CHW and facilities. Ideally, economic evaluation metrics would involve various perspectives —health systems, societal, etc.—to reflect savings for households, facilities, or administrative/governments [17, 79].

The experts also agreed that these recommendations strike a balance between a pragmatic minimum set of indicators and a more exhaustive set of metrics that would be costly and impractical to measure with regularity.

CHWs work in a wide variety of contexts: from institutionalized, salaried roles well-integrated in the public health sector [ 13], to informal, volunteer-based work acting as important community educators and linkages between communities and the health system. CHWs may also deliver multiple interrelated and interdependent interventions simultaneously. Their services may involve activities across different levels of the health system, including referrals made to the health facilities [ 54]. This variability in their roles and range of services contributes to the challenge of standardizing metrics to measure the performance of CHW programs and attribute their impact on health outcomes [ 48]", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

The appropriate selection of indicators depends on the maturity of the community health system, as well as the types of data that are considered most critical to advocate for such community-based interventions nationally. The maturity of a CHW program can be observed in the degree to which the community health system is integrated with the formal health system (at national, regional, district, and facility levels). In some contexts, CHW programs operate as disparate stand-alone, NGO or private sector-led programs that may run in parallel to the public health system. In more mature settings, CHW programs are formally aligned with well-established government policy, with a formal governance structure, funding support, training agenda, job description, appropriate support from public health facilities, and efforts to integrate care from the community to the health facility", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Within the proposed framework, some performance indicators will be more relevant to early CHW initiatives, while others will only become useful as the CHW service delivery layer becomes fully integrated into the health system. The framework in Fig. 2 articulates measurement domains that should be captured by CHW programs, and the illustrative indicators in Table 2 represent a more pragmatic approach reflective of the limitations in standardized indicators, capacity for data collection and aggregation at the community level, and limited availability of community-based census or “denominator” data. The framework is limited to CHW programs targeted at health outcomes. However, the authors recognize the need for a multisectoral approach at the community level and the potential contributions of CHWs in education, agriculture, and other sectors", "year": 2019, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Indicators for inputs (existing governance, policy, funding, and information systems) were not included largely due to their high variability across CHW program contexts. The framework and approach does not provide country-specific guidance for actionable use of particular indicators. Country-level adaptation and testing of indicators in practice can overcome this limitation. These limitations highlight opportunities to strengthen the measurement of community health systems.

To facilitate standardization, development and validation of comprehensive indicators is important. Advances on this front are ongoing, as in the case of the recently proposed six-item perceived supervision scale that has been validated in seven languages [ 54]. In practice, a more limited subset of the proposed metrics that have been validated and found most valuable to global and national decision-making should be identified and disseminated. An example of metrics prioritization is seen in Liberia, where a focus on quality has led to continued optimization of a nationally implemented CHW program. It should be noted that in emergency and f ragile settings, CHW programs often emerge organically from the needs of the community. The most pertinent areas of measurement for such settings need to be identified and tested.

The framework does not cover the full range of the community health system space, which involves more multisectoral players. Of critical importance is the need to strengthen community health information systems (CHIS). Where previously, much of the community-level da ta collection and aggregation occurred manually on paper, the rapid digitization of health service data and data collection using mobile devices has opened new frontiers for enhancing CHIS performance [60].

Several parallel investments are already ongoing. For example, the Health Data Collaborative community data sub-group aims to harmonize and endorse standards for CHIS to maximize integration with national health information systems. At the global level, the National Health Workforce Accounts were proposed at the 69th World Health Assembly and present a set of 78 indicators that can be collected nationally to improve the availability, quality, and use of data on human resources for health [29].

There are limited publications on national health information systems that continuously generate health data. Given the need to develop these systems, we summarised their current status in lowincome and middle-income countries. setting The survey team jointly developed a questionnaire covering policy, planning, legislation and organisation of case reporting, patient monitoring and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems. From January until May 2017, we administered the questionnaire to key informants in 51 Centers for Disease Control country offices. Countries were aggregated for descriptive analyses in Microsoft Excel. results Key informants in 15 countries responded to the questionnaire. Several key informants did not answer all questions, leading to different denominators across questions. The Ministry of Health coordinated case reporting, patient monitoring and CRVS systems in 93% (14/15), 93% (13/14) and 53% (8/15) of responding countries, respectively", "year": 2019, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Domestic financing supported case reporting, patient monitoring and CRVS systems in 86% (12/14), 75% (9/12) and 92% (11/12) of responding countries, respectively. The most common uses for system-generated data were to guide programme response in 100% (15/15) of countries for case reporting, to calculate service coverage in 92% (12/13) of countries for patient monitoring and to estimate the national burden of disease in 83% (10/12) of countries for CRVS.

There was funding for these systems from national budgets, bilateral arrangements and multilateral mechanisms, suggesting some level of political commitment for their development and implementation. Many countries also reported use of electronic and individual-level data, suggesting that more granular and accessible data may be available for end-users. Overall, these are encouraging trends which will hopefully continue in order to accelerate progress towards meeting the SDGs", "year": 2019, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Overall, these are encouraging trends which will hopefully continue in order to accelerate progress towards meeting the SDGs. Importantly, these results are indicative of systems interpreted by key informants as meeting the survey definitions and do not speak to the breadth of coverage relative to specific diseases or interoperability. The majority of responding countries had >75% geographic coverage of their case reporting system. Moreover, most responding countries had an electronic component to their system. Electronic systems could help store increased volumes of data over time, store more detailed data prospectively and provide more rapid access to such data compared with paper-based systems. 16 Understanding the number of diagnosed cases of diseases can directly inform programme response to contain transmission. 8 All responding countries used case reporting data to achieve this", "year": 2019, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

For example, in Uganda a command centre was created to house an interdisciplinary rapid response team to receive, evaluate and distribute information as the centre of communication and coordination response operations. 17 Many diseases require their own diagnostic commodities as part of national diagnostic algorithms. For example, HIV requires combinations of two or three rapid tests to diagnose each case. 18 Approximately half of responding countries used case reporting data for commodity forecasting. As observed with medicines, central procurement, informed by case reporting data, could provide cost savings and increase availability of diagnostics at service delivery sites. 19 The primary use of data from patient monitoring systems by responding countries was to monitor coverage of services", "year": 2019, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

This is likely due to the importance of monitoring the coverage of key health sector interventions for reproductive health, communicable diseases and national immunisation schedules. 5 Countries may also have disease-specific patient monitoring systems. Many countries are embarking on the development of national health insurance schemes as part of universal healthcare coverage. 20 Given the wide geographic scale, and use of individual-level electronic data in many settings, there may be an opportunity to leverage these systems for processing claims and co-payments for services rendered. 21 Based on this survey, some countries are using the same system for social health insurance while others have linked the patient monitoring system to the health insurance system.

Overall, more countries reported systems for registering birth events relative to deaths. This is consistent with globally available data suggesting that birth registration rates are higher than death registration rates. 6 ICD-10 remains the global norm for classifying the cause of death within the health sector. 22 In this survey, the majority of responding countries reported use of ICD-10 for classifying the cause of death. Death registration, and methods to ascertain the cause of death, are more heterogeneous in communities. Verbal autopsy has shown promise as an option to incorporate within CRVS systems when medical certification of cause of death is not possible 23 and many countries reported using this approach.

For example, there were a range of approaches for identification of people in systems. These included using national identification, health identification and system-generated identification. Across all systems national identification was used most often. Given the global momentum behind achieving SDG target 16.9, achieving free and universal legal identity by 2030, use of national identification may increase further with time. 28 Security measures to protect data from unauthorised use has emerged as a critical issue in light of the transition to electronic data systems. 29 In this survey, physical barriers, software barriers, legal barriers, encryption and use of unique identifiers were security measures used", "year": 2019, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Specifically, there were limited responses from the Americas, Central Asia and Eastern Europe.

Prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, and diagnostic radiology are common targets.  Providers find PA to be a burden that has been increasing. Payers believe PA policies are necessary and effective and continue to invest in the infrastructure to implement them.  Potential benefits of PA include reduced provision of avoidable or non-value-added care, a reduction in health spending or a shift of resources to higher value care, an acceleration in adoption of new standards of care, and the prevention of fraud or abuse", "year": 2019, "topics": ["prior-authorization", "quality"], "category": "policy"}

The findings are based on a review of the peer-reviewed and gray literature and interviews with industry experts, as documented in Appendix A. 1.1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DEFINED Prior authorization – also known as precertification, preauthorization, prior approval, prior notification, prospective review, and prior review – requires health care providers to establish eligibility and obtain approval from the patient’s health plan before care is delivered to qualify for payment", "year": 2019, "topics": ["prior-authorization", "quality"], "category": "policy"}

Payers use PA as a strategy to reduce utilization of overused or low-value services, reduce spending, and improve care quality.1 Health care payers employ physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals to support the development and execution of PA policies. These policies are routinely updated based on new treatments and medical guidelines, and their application can accelerate the adoption of new standards of care. The types of care that require PA vary by payer, based on utilization patterns, clinical evidence, financial considerations, and government regulations and statute. This lack of consistency is one of the challenges facing providers in meeting PA requirements. Common types of care requiring PA include prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, diagnostic radiology, surgical procedures, inpatient stays, and behavioral health treatments.

With the introduction of a new generation of highly targeted and expensive drug therapies, drugs are likely to remain an area of focus for PA. Step therapy, also known as “fail first,” is an extension of PA and a common formulary tool used to manage prescription drug use. Step therapy requires that patients try lower-cost drugs – usually biosimilars or generics – before a costlier or brand name drug will be covered.2 If the patient responds well to the lower-cost option, the patient, provider, and payer continue with that prescription", "year": 2019, "topics": ["prior-authorization", "quality"], "category": "policy"}

Other common methods for submission of PA requests include fax, secure email, phone, and use of the payer’s digital portal. Once a PA request is submitted, it is reviewed by trained clinical staff such as pharmacists or registered nurses and approved or denied. The length of time before requests are processed varies by type of care, payer type, use of automation, and other factors, ranging from same day to several days. When a PA request is denied, providers and patients have the option to appeal; under the Affordable Care Act, all health plans are required to have such an appeal process.

Traditional Medicare was historically restricted from imposing PA requirements under the Social Security Act (SSA). In recent years, the SSA was amended to allow PA to be tested and evaluated under Medicare fee-for-service for several categories of care, including repetitive, scheduled, non-emergency ambulance transport, non-emergent hyperbaric oxygen, home health care, and power mobility devices.

We provide examples of specific strategies being explored and implemented today within each of these categories. 4.1 STANDARDIZATION One of the largest complaints made by providers and medical office staff is the lack of consistency in the PA process by payer. Physician groups such as the AMA have pushed to improve the PA process by increasing consistency and standardization across payer groups. Payers share these goals and are working internally to streamline the PA process.

Standardization of Services Covered Physicians, through the AMA, have sought to standardize services requiring PA. Creating a standardized list of services that must go through a PA process for all payers would help to reduce the time burden and administrative frustrations. Given the differences payers face in in populations served, patterns of spending, state and federal laws and regulations, and other pressures, it may not be feasible to develop a single standardized list of types of care requiring PA, but any movement toward greater consistency across payers would bring greater efficiency and less uncertainty to providers", "year": 2019, "topics": ["prior-authorization", "quality"], "category": "policy"}

Those who work to submit PA requests have expressed concern that there is not a standardized submission process for PA, leading to the creation of too many workflows, workarounds, and delays in PA submission. Often, approvals of authorization requests are delayed due to missing information. Consistency in submission processes would make it easier to develop manual or automated systems to meet information requirements and reduce such delays", "year": 2019, "topics": ["prior-authorization", "quality"], "category": "policy"}

If it is determined that PA is required, process automation can also support the auto-population of PA requests with patient and clinical data from the electronic health record, reducing the time required to create a submission.

PA can reduce avoidable care while helping to control health care expenditures. It can also hasten adoption of new standards of care. On the other hand, the process imposes time and cost burdens, can result in delays in needed care, and causes confusion and often frustration for providers and patients. The current literature on PA finds evidence of both savings and burdens but stops short of a combined cost-benefit analysis. Payers clearly believe the benefits of PA outweigh the additional administrative costs, or they would not be increasing their use of these policies and continuing to invest in process improvements", "year": 2019, "topics": ["prior-authorization", "quality"], "category": "policy"}
{"doc": "2019_PriorAuthorization_Impacts_Costs_Quality.pdf", "page": 15, "chunk_id": 759, "text": ". For providers, PA would appear to impose costs with few benefits, requiring them to justify their patient care plans, devote additional clinical and administrative resources, and potentially delay care to their patents. Providers, however, have historically been insulated from cost or value considerations, and may move slowly to change practice patterns or reduce delivery of low value care.32 Whether reducing health care spending or increasing medical practice expenses, ultimately both the costs and the benefits associated with these programs are borne by all of us as patients, employees, and taxpayers. The goal is to refine PA policies and processes so that they retain their benefits while minimizing the associated burdens. It is encouraging to see legislative action and health care industry activities around standardizing, streamlining, automating, and targeting PA requirements, which will only increase the net benefit of these programs.", "year": 2019, "topics": ["prior-authorization", "quality"], "category": "policy"}

Consequently, the sets of criteria change from one context to another, especially when used in non-emergency settings. This paper systematically synthesizes and analyzes the published evidence concerning the development and challenges related to the validation and implementation of PPTs in non-emergency settings. Methods: We conducted a systematic mixed studies review. We searched evidence in five databases to select articles based on eligibility criteria, and information of included articles was extracted using an extraction grid. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The article selection process, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed by at least two reviewers independently. Results: We included 48 studies listing 34 different patient prioritization tools. Most of them are designed for managing access to elective surgeries in hospital settings", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Two-thirds of the tools were investigated based on reliability or validity. Inconclusive results were found regarding the impact of PPTs on patient waiting times. Advantages associated with PPT use were found mostly in relationship to acceptability of the tools by clinicians and increased transparency and equity for patients. Conclusions: This review describes the development and validation processes of PPTs used in non-urgent healthcare settings. Despite the large number of PPTs studied, implementation into clinical practice seems to be an open challenge. Based on the findings of this review, recommendations are proposed to develop, validate, and implement such tools in clinical settings.

Patients waiting for non-urgent health services such as elective surgeries and rehabilitation services can suffer physical and psychological sequelae [ 2]. To reduce these negative effects, waiting lists should be managed as fairly as possible to ensure that patients with greater or more serious needs are given priority for treatment [ 3]. Patient prioritization, defined as the process of ranking referrals in a certain order based on criteria, is one of the possible strategies to improve fairness in waiting list management [4]. This practice is used in many settings, and it differs from a first-in first-out (FIFO) approach that ranks patients on waiting lists chronologically, according to their arrival", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2020_Patient_Prioritization_WaitingLists_HealthServices.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 859, "text": ". It also differs from triage methods used in emergency departments where patients are sorted into broader categories (e.g., low/moderate/high priority or service/no service). Prioritization is related to non-urgent services involving a broader range of timeframes and patient types [2, 5]. The use of prioritization is widely reported, yet not fully described, in services provided by allied health professionals, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, or psychologists as well as multidisciplinary allied health teams [ 2]. In practice, however, assessing patients ’ priority on the basis of explicit criteria is complex and, to a certain degree, inconsistent [ 6–8]. Moreover, most prioritization criteria are subjectively defined, and comparing patients’ needs and referrals can be challenging [ 8]. Patient prioritization tools are designed to support the decision process leading to patient sorting in an explicit, transparent, and fair manner", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2020_Patient_Prioritization_WaitingLists_HealthServices.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 860, "text": ". Patient prioritization tools are designed to support the decision process leading to patient sorting in an explicit, transparent, and fair manner. Such tools or systems are usually set up to help clinicians or managers to make decisions about which patients should be seen first when demand is great and resources are limited [ 2]. We define patient prioritization tools as paper-and-pencil or computer-based instruments that support patient prioritization processes, either by stating explicit and standardized prioritization criteria, or by enabling easier or better calculation of priority scores, or because they automatically include the patients into a ranked list. PPTs are mainly built around sets of general criteria that encompass personal factors (i.e., age), social factors (i.e., ability to work), clinical factors (i.e., patients ’ quality of life), and any other factor deemed relevant [ 1, 3, 5]", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2020_Patient_Prioritization_WaitingLists_HealthServices.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 861, "text": ". Since tools can take various forms and they are very dependent on the particular context of application, some of the literature reports a lack of consistency in the way they are developed [ 5, 6]. In healthcare, the process of validating a new tool to measure an abstract phenomenon such as quality of life, patient adherence, and urgency/needs in the case of PPTs, is in large part oriented toward the evaluation and the reduction of errors in the measurement process [ 9]. The process of a measure, a tool, or an instrument ’s quality assessment involves investigating their reliability and validity. Reliability estimates are used to evaluate the stability of measures gathered at different time intervals on the same individuals (intra-rater reliability), the link and coherence of items from the same test (internal consistency), or the stability of scores for a behavior or event using the same instrument by different observers (inter-rater reliability) [ 9]", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2020_Patient_Prioritization_WaitingLists_HealthServices.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 862, "text": ". There are many approaches to measure validity of a tool and in the context of our review, we identified those more relevant. Construct validity is the extent to which the instrument measures what it says it measures [ 10]. Content validity addresses the representativeness of the measurement tool in capturing the major elements or different facets relevant to the construct being measured, which can be in part assessed by stakeholders ’ opinion (face validity) [ 10]. Criterionrelated validity evaluates how closely the results of a tool correspond to the results of another tool. As in the case of patient prioritizing, much of the research conducted in healthcare involves quantifying abstract concepts that cannot be measured precisely, such as the severity of a disease and patient satisfaction. Validity evidence is built over time, with validations occurring in a variety of populations [ 9]", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Validity evidence is built over time, with validations occurring in a variety of populations [ 9]. Aside from the validation process, there is no consensus in the literature about the effect of PPTs on healthcare service delivery, patient flow, or stakeholders. Some studies state that the prioritization process is associated with lower waiting times [ 11–13], but a systematic review of triage systems indicates mixed results on waiting time reduction [ 14]. It is difficult to assess these findings considering the variance between research settings and the nature of the considered prioritization system, tool, or process used in the studies. For example, Harding et al. [ 14] included studies about any system that either ranked patients in order of priority or sorted patients into the most appropriate service, which are two completely different systems. These authors also merged results from emergency and non-emergency settings, which are contrasting contexts of healthcare", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

These authors concluded that although waiting times for knee arthroplasty dropped to an average wait of between 3 and 4 months throughout the period studied, they coul d not ascertain that it was directly related to the use of the prioritization system [ 62]. The other three studies conducted a retrospective analysis of patients on waiting lists [ 13, 58, 64]. With a PPT [13] using a total score of priority then sorting patients in groups (group 1 having the greatest need for surgery and group 4 the least need), the mean waiting time for surgery was 3 years shorter across all indication groups. In a study with patients waiting for cardiac surgery, the clinician’s classification was compared to the New Zealand priority scores (0-100) based on clinical features [58]", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

According to this study, it is difficult to determine whether waiting times were reduced as a result of the use of the PPT, because findings only showed the reorganization of the waiting list based on each category and priority scores. However, waiting times were reduced for the least urgent patients in both groups. Waiting times before surgery were between 161 and 1199 days based on the clinician ’s classifications compared to waiting times related to New Zealand priority scores, which were between 58 and 486 days [ 58].

Effects on the care process Some studies address the effects of PPT on the demand for healthcare services [ 44, 46, 50, 64]. The introduction of a new need-based prioritization system for hip and knee arthroplasty has reduced the number of inquiries and cancelations [ 46]. Changes were also observed after the implementation of a PPT for physiotherapy services with an increase of 38% of high priority clients in their caseload [ 50]. PPTs also had an impact on the healthcare delivery process. For example, Mifflin and Bzdell [ 50] reported improvement in communication between physiotherapists and other health professionals in remote areas. Furthermore, Isojoki et al. [ 44] demonstrated that the priority ratings made by experts in adolescent psychiatry were correlated with the type and duration of the treatment received", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

This suggests that the PPT identified adolescents with the greatest need of psychiatric care and that it might, to some extent, predict the intensity of the treatment to be delivered [ 44]. The system proposed by Valente et al. [ 64] enabled easy and coherent scheduling and reduced postponements [ 64]. Other outcomes related to the use of PPTs Although some attempts have been made to assess the positive impacts of PPTs on patients, the results reported are not consistent enough to confirm such benefits.

Benefits and limitations of PPTs The challenge of producing long-term assessments of PPT benefits has led researchers to rely on qualitative methods, i.e., stakeholder perceptions concerning acceptability and benefits of PPTs. Focus groups including the general public indicated that the tools presented in five different clinical areas 1 were appropriate and acceptable [ 48].

It also improved transparency and equity for patients, as well as accuracy of waiting times [ 36]. In another study, physiotherapists reported increased job satisfaction, decreased job stress, and less time spent triaging referrals [50]. They also commented that, compared to the methods used before the tool was introduced [ 50], PPT allowed physiotherapy services to be delivered more equitably.

On a less positive note, some authors reported that PPTs were perceived as lacking flexibility, which limited their acceptance by surgeons [ 36, 49]. In a study surveying surgeons about the use of PPTs, only 19.5% agreed that current PPTs were an effective method of prioritizing patients, and 44.8% felt that further development of surgical scoring tools had the potential to provide an effective way of prioritizing patients [ 49]. In fact, most surgeons felt that their clinical judgment was the most effective way of prioritizing patients [ 49]. Many studies mentioned the need to support implementation of PPTs in clinical practice and to involve potential tool users in the implementation process [ 21, 31, 48, 57, 60]. In this vein, another recommendation concerning implementation was to secure agreement and to assess acceptability of the criteria and the tool in clinical settings [ 60]", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Implementation should also involve continuous monitoring and an evaluation of the effects of implementation on patient outcomes, on resource use, and on the patient-provider relationship [ 31]. Discussion The aim of this systematic review was to gather and synthesize information about PPTs in non-emergency healthcare contexts in order to develop a better understanding of their characteristics and to find out to what extent they have been proven to be reliable, valid, and effective methods of managing access to non-urgent healthcare services.

We have also synthesized the quality assessment processes conducted in the literature to apprise interested readers and encourage further research on PPT development and validation. The overall effectiveness of PPTs was difficult to demonstrate according to our findings, essentially because the articles showed mixed results about reduction of waiting times and because of the lack of studies measuring PPT impact on patients. However, a few studies demonstrated benefits according to the general public, clinicians, and physicians, in terms of a more equitable and reliable delivery of services. PPTs are used to manage access to a given healthcare service by helping service providers to prioritize patients on a waiting list. The use of PPTs as scoring measures provides a relatively transparent and standardized method for assigning priority to patients on waiting lists [ 68]", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Measuring abstract constructs, such as the relative priority of the patients ’ need to obtain access to a healthcare service is, indeed, a complex task. The findings of this review show that PPT development processes are, at best, heterogeneous. However, our systematic review demonstrates that certain development steps are present in most studies. Based on these results, and supported by studies that showed reliable and valid PPTs, we can draw some recommendations or guidelines for the development of reliable, valid, userfriendly, and acceptable tools (see Table 3). Recommendations are formulated regarding preliminary steps, development, evaluation, and finally the implementation of PPTs. Our systematic review broadens earlier research reviewing priority scoring tools used for prioritizing patients in elective surgery settings [ 5] to more general patient prioritization tools and to all non-urgent healthcare settings.

Harding et al. conducted two systematic reviews, which focused specifically on triage methods [ 6] and their impact on patient flow in a broad spectrum of health services [ 14]. Our review distinguishes prioritization tools and triage systems. Triage and prioritization are often used interchangeably because both terms refer to allocating services to patients at the point of service delivery [ 2]. In fact, triage was traditionally associated with emergency services, but it was also used in other healthcare settings, and it relates to the process of making a decision about the type of service needed (for example, the need for a physical therapist versus a therapy assistant) and whether there is such a need at all [ 2]. Prioritization is a process of ranking patient needs for non-urgent services and as such, it involves a broader range of timeframes and patient types [2, 5]", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2020_Patient_Prioritization_WaitingLists_HealthServices.pdf", "page": 11, "chunk_id": 908, "text": ". Whereas triage sorts patients into broader categories (e.g., low/moderate/high priority or service/no service), it can nevertheless imply a prioritization process, as presented in our results. Harding et al. ’s review [ 14] included any system that either ranked patients in order of priority, or sorted patients into the most appropriate service. Additionally, 64% of the studies included were conducted in acute care hospital emergency departments [ 14]. Since both terms coexist in the literature, we included studies that used prioritization tools, which only rank patients in order of priority. Based on this, we obtained a better picture of the prioritization tools used, and we found that prioritization is more often used in non-urgent healthcare settings, without using a sorting (triage) process", "year": 2020, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

By excluding studies in emergency and life-threatening settings, we can assume that the evidence reviewed relates more to an assessment of patient priority based on needs and social characteristics, and less to an urgency to receive a given service [ 3]. As demonstrated by the wide range of PPTs reviewed, prioritization is used in managing access to care across many healthcare settings other than emergency departments, such as elective surgeries, rehabilitation, and mental health services. We listed 16 specific types of non-urgent healthcare services and we found that most of the criteria used are generic, such as the threat to the patient ’s ability to play a role, functional limitations, pain, and probability of Table 3 Recommendations and guidelines for PPT development projects Prior to tool development Tool development Evaluation and Implementation 1.

Two PPTs used only specific criteria related to the disease, i.e., varicose vein surgery [ 52] and orthodontic treatment [ 51]. We demonstrated that even prioritization tools used in specific health condition services included generic criteria to prioritize patients on waiting lists. These findings suggest that generic criteria, such as non-clinical or social factors, could be added to condition-specific criteria in PPTs to represent more fairly and precisely patients ’ needs to receive healthcare services. One of the limitations of this systematic review is that the search strategy was restricted to the English and French languages.

Conclusion Long waiting times and other problems of access to healthcare services are important challenges that public healthcare systems face. Patient prioritization could help to manage access to care in an equitable manner. Development and validation processes are widely described for PPTs in non-urgent healthcare settings, mainly in the contexts of elective surgeries, but implementation into clinical practice seems to be a challenge. Although we were able to put forward some recommendations to support the development of reliable and valid PPTs for non-urgent services, we believe that more standardized projects need to be conducted and supported in order to evaluate facilitators and barriers to the implementation of such innovations. Further research is also needed to explore the outcomes of PPT use —other than their effects on waiting times —in clinical settings.

Introduction The Health Care Network (Rede de Atenção à Saúde, RAS) in Brazil proposes an integration among services and aims to contemplate the doctrinal and organizational principles of the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde , SUS). However, the system still faces obstacles to consolidate this integration, and the fragmentation is also reflected within hospital institutions with isolated and incommunicable departments, which directly affects the resolvability, accountability, and integrality of care(1). The organizational structure of Brazilian public hospitals usually follows the guidelines established by the classic organization charts of the administration, in which hierarchy, authoritarianism, and decision-making centrality stand out, which results in little cooperation, difficulty in working in teams and developing interdisciplinarity(2)", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2020_PatientSafety_Quality_PermanentEducation_Hospitals.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 940, "text": ". In this sense, considering the history of fragmentation of hospital institutions, with regard to the arrangement of the organizational structure, as well as the performance of health professionals, it is relevant to investigate how these aspects affect the management of Permanent Education in Health (PEH) for patient safety and quality, since education is an essential practice in building safer and quality patient care(3-4). Furthermore, it can be said that the quality of hospital care is directly related to the quality of care provided by the professionals who work in this scenario. A number of studies discuss patient safety and quality of care as if they were interdependent elements. However, PEH is considered an important, but still secondary, component in the context of the implementation of safety and quality actions in hospital institutions(3-5)", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2020_PatientSafety_Quality_PermanentEducation_Hospitals.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 941, "text": ". This study defends the need to place these three axes in the same level of importance and relevance in order to achieve the articulation indispensable to the necessary paradigmatic change. Thus, the management of PEH in hospital institutions carries the need for interaction between the actors that make up this scenario, such as managers, professionals, and patients, considering that human interaction promotes the construction of new knowledge or the reformulation of other knowledge previously evidenced, and that health care demands the permanent articulation of knowledge and professional practices in order to build a more comprehensive health model(6)", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2020_PatientSafety_Quality_PermanentEducation_Hospitals.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 942, "text": ". In this scenario, nurses are important actors in the process of transition and restructuring of the services, since they have management training and are constantly involved in actions that encompass the inclusion of patients in health care, the improvement of the nursing team, the integration of the multiprofessional team, humanization of care, patient safety, and quality of care, among others. In this sense, the following question emerges: How does the professional interaction take place in the hospital organizational structure for management of Permanent Education in Health in order to ensure patient safety and the quality of nursing care? The study aimed to understand how professional interaction takes place in the hospital organizational structure for the management of Permanent Education in Health in order to ensure patient safety and the quality of nursing care", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}

Method This is a qualitative study, which used the structuralist aspect of the Grounded Theory (GT) as a methodological framework. The scenario selected included hospital institutions under direct public administration in a state in southern Brazil. Among the 13 institutions, three were chosen as the collection scenario, all being large hospitals located in three different regions of the state, as well as the State Health Secretariat (SHS), which were included in the study according to the theoretical sample(7). Theoretical sampling is circularly constructed, allowing for the construction of concepts that lead the researcher to new questions or hypotheses to be answered with new data collection.

The central category reveals that the PEH, safety, and quality triad is the guiding line of the professional interaction process in hospital institutions. PEH management was not revealed in isolation, since PEH, patient safety, and quality of care showed a movement of interdependence. In this context, the professional interaction reveals the concern with improving patient care, which means a need to work for safe and qualified care. In turn, this care refers not only to nursing care, but to multiprofessional and interdisciplinary health care centered on the patient, this configuration being essential in the process of breaking the culture of fragmentation in hospital institutions.

Discussion The first point to be discussed (which has a strong impact when talking about the management of Permanent Education in Health, patient safety, and quality of care in public hospitals) is the instability and high turnover of managers in this scenario, which results in discontinuity of projects, constant restarts, and consequent demotivation of the professionals(1,10)", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}

In addition to the frequent change of managers, the scarcity of professionals prepared to work in the management of the SUS is a reality and was linked in a study to the deficit in the management training of health professionals and to inefficient permanent education in the field. Furthermore, the manager’s difficulty in seeking management models beyond the traditional one, characterized by centralized, hierarchical, and bureaucratic actions, represents the managerial ability incompatible with the needs and complexities of the health care sector(1). In order to integrate and enhance safety and quality actions, in some hospitals of this study the support services started to take place in the same physical space. However, the need was clear for a change in the mentality of the professionals to understand that this work requires more than sharing the same physical space, being necessary to work in an integrated way", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}

Thus, the articulation between the different services in the organizational structure is conditioned to the recognition of the insufficiency of these isolated services in providing comprehensive care to the patient(6). PEH management was identified when, aiming to implement safety and quality actions, the coordinators of the support services sought to approach and raise awareness among care professionals through in loco educational actions. These educational actions, when carried out within an institutional plan or project, such as the patient safety plan and certification project, can be characterized as PEH practices, as they have a continuity character, undergo an evaluation process, and meet organizational objectives(11)", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}

This context, however, requires the encouragement of effective communication, feedback to the professionals, management support, teamwork, autonomy, and professional initiatives, these being potential actions to reduce resistance to change by the professionals, in addition to contributing to innovation in the health care services(12). The organizational structure interferes with the management of the triad because it is directly influenced by the organizational culture, which can be understood as a process that involves a combination of factors such as customs, habits, rules, and formal and informal communication, among others (13-14) that influence all actions within the institution. This is partly the result of the training of the health professionals, since it occurs in a fragmented way and ends up building strict professional identities, which hinders communication and interaction among them(15)", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}

A number of studies indicate that this situation causes concerns among nurses, as it directly and negatively influences their work process(2,17).

To this end, the institutions must have collegiate spaces, such as centers and commissions, which can be daily shared by the professionals in order to favor interaction (18), communication(19-21), and teamwork(18). The managers’ support was revealed in this study as an important encouragement in the implementation of institutional improvement processes since, even though they are not the only ones responsible for the success of the institutional projects, they are responsible for strengthening the interaction of the multiprofessional team, monitoring and demand in order to attain the institutional objectives", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}

In addition, despite the results presenting SHS initiatives to support the triad management in the hospital institutions, the participants reinforced the need for the SHS to monitor and demand actions. In this sense, there is a need for “participative supervision” that helps, empowers, and enables active and critical participation in order to develop professional skills with the potential to transform reality(25). Extra-institutional incentives, such as multiprofessional internship training and PROADI-SUS projects, were considered to be boosters of the triad management in this study, as they motivate interdisciplinary interaction.

In the implementation and development of the projects coordinated by PROADI-SUS, it was noticed that the professionals’ satisfaction and motivation were directly related to their participation in the decisionmaking process. A study carried out at the Valladolid Hospital in Spain assessed the nursing staff’s level of satisfaction with the implementation of measures to improve the quality of care and showed that the staff’s satisfaction favored patient safety and satisfaction in addition to quality of care (27), corroborating the results of this study", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}

The practice of leadership is associated with positive results in the health scenario, such as team satisfaction and engagement, quality of care, and construction of the organizational culture(28). In addition, committed leadership, effective communication, feedback, and environments focused on learning were considered in the study as potential factors for improving institutional processes(21).

However, it should be noted that the fact that nurses are more engaged in safety actions does not place them as the main responsible for the success or not of these actions at the institutional level. Building a safety culture is a joint work that involves the multiprofessional team and managers. Finally, the results show the need for a paradigm shift based on the construction of the culture of PEH, safety, and quality supported by interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinary interaction is one of the main challenges for health care. The professionals need to learn to work in an integrated way, to break the disciplinary barriers, and to rethink ways of interaction so that health care is integrative (29), since the fragmentation of the work process hinders work in interdisciplinary team (2) and interferes with the construction of a new culture(21)", "year": 2020, "topics": ["quality"], "category": "general"}

In this regard, it is worth noting that cultural change in an institution is not a radical replacement of an old model with a new one, but rather a construction process that involves tensions and conflicts since, in the hospital scenario, the current model of health care, focused on diseases and fragmented work, lives with the perception of the need for interdisciplinary work, which questions the fragmentation of the care provided to the patient(30). Interdisciplinary interaction means a relationship of interdependence and cooperation between different disciplines around a common goal (31) and, therefore, it is necessary to resist biomedical logic(32).

The same visit could be billed for $331 if the office were designated a hospital outpatient department, thereby generating a facility fee in addition to the phy - sician fee", "year": 2021, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced siteneutral rulemaking that took effect on January 1, 2019, decreasing off-campus hospital outpatient department reimbursement to office levels for certain patient visits. Although litigation against the rule is ongoing, CMS has pursued its site-neutral policies in 2020", "year": 2021, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Although litigation against the rule is ongoing, CMS has pursued its site-neutral policies in 2020. 8 Despite this move toward site-neutral payments, little is known about the extent to which site-based payment influences hospi - tal-physician integration. While hospitals can increase reimbursement from physician services through integration, site-based payment may not be a major factor in integration decisions. Instead, hospitals may be driven more by the desire to gain leverage in price negotiations with commercial payers 9 and influence physician refer - ral behavior and hospital choice. 10,11 Integration could also be driven by a shared desire across hospitals and physicians to enhance care coordination, facilitate health information exchange, or adapt to new payment models. 4 In this paper, we examined the relationship between site-based Medicare payment differences and integration", "year": 2021, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Using 2010-2016 Medicare data, we calculated the reimbursement value of each phy - sician's services if billed from a hospital outpatient department and compared it to the value if billed from an office. We then assessed whether hospital outpatient payment differentials were associated with greater likelihood of hospitals integrating with the physician practice, hypothesizing that larger payment differentials would lead to greater integration. 2 |  METHODS We used several data sets. Our claims-level data included the Medicare 20% sample files of Part B claims and the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files (MEDPAR).

All datasets included years 2010-2016. We extracted a number of key variables from these datasets. The claims files allowed us to characterize several aspects of a phy - sician's practice, including whether a physician was integrated with a hospital and the market concentration of hospitals and physicians.

To calculate the magnitude of this fi - nancial benefit, we examined the full bundle of services for which a physician billed Medicare in 2010, using the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes found on each claim.

For a simplified example, take a physician who performs only three services in a year. We identified which services (ie, which HCPCS codes) these were through the Part B claims. We then iden - tified the reimbursement value for each of these services using the PFS and OPPS files. In this example, suppose that the PFS and OPPS indicated that Medicare reimbursed Service 1 in the office at $50 and in the hospital outpatient department at $75; Service 2 at $100 and $190; and Service 3 at $80 and $87", "year": 2021, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

This physician's hospital-office ratio is 1.85 (352/230). Each physician thus had their own hospital-office ratio in every year, with variation in this ratio across physicians driven by differences in the bundle of services that each physician delivered to their patients. This measure exhibits variation across specialty (since physicians of different specialties perform different procedures, each of which is associated with a dif - ferent hospital-office payment disparity) as well as within specialty (since each physician within a specialty performs a slightly different bundle of procedures depending on patient need).

One potential confounder in this measure is that relying on the set of services a physician performed in each year could create selection: Physicians could have responded to price changes by adjusting the quantity of different services in their bundles each year. This would confound the effect of Medicare's price updates with physi - cian behavior. To isolate the effect of price updates, we fixed each physician's bundle of services at their 2010 values. We calculated each physician's annual hospital-office ratio from 2011 through 2016 by applying Medicare's prices from each respective year to the physician's 2010 bundle of services. Each year, Medicare provides annual updates to the price for each service, leading to variation over time in the relative value of services performed in the hospital out - patient department compared to the office.

The physician fee, when generated from a hospital outpatient department, is smaller than the physician fee when generated from an office; however, with the addition of the facility fee, the total reimbursement for the services performed by an integrated physician is larger than an equivalent physician bill - ing from an office.

The legality of this payment rule is subject to a lawsuit by the American Hospital Association, but as of January 1, 2019, clinic visits began being paid the same reimbursement as an office. CMS projected that these changes would save the Medicare program $380 million in 2019 and $760 million in 2020. 23 Our re - sults imply that this change could have a cooling effect on vertical integration. We conclude by noting that our work warrants further in - quiry into the causes of hospital-physician vertical integration. Medicare outpatient payment policies are unlikely to be the only or even the main reason for hospital-physician vertical integra - tion. In our study, other factors, including market concentration, exerted larger effects. Moreover, disparities in payment rates between hospital outpatient departments and offices existed for many years without an acceleration in integration", "year": 2021, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Methods: A meta-regression analysis using 116 studies evaluating P4P schemes published between January 2010 to February 2018. The effects of the research design, incentive schemes, use of incentives, and the size of the payment to revenue ratio on the proportion of statically significant effects in each study were examined.

Using financial incentives targeted at healthcare providers to improve value-based healthcare provision is a key policy issue. Many governments and insurers use P4P schemes as a policy lever to change healthcare providers ’ behavior to improve value for money in healthcare and make providers accountable. However, numerous literature reviews based on narrative syntheses of evidence have concluded that the evidence on P4P schemes ’ impacts is both weak and heterogeneous (see, for instance [ 1–3]). The key reasons proposed for the weak evidence is that schemes have been either poorly designed (insufficient size of incentives, unintended consequences, unclear objectives, crowding out of intrinsic motivation, myopia, multi-tasking concerns, external validity, the scheme is voluntary, gaming), or poorly evaluated (poor study designs where causality cannot be inferred, no account of provider selection into or out of schemes, poor reporting © The Author(s)", "year": 2021, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

In this paper, we examined whether more recent studies provided improved evidence on the effectiveness of P4P schemes. One may expect that those designing and evaluating P4P schemes are improving how these schemes work and are being assessed. We updated the first meta-regression analysis of the effectiveness of P4P schemes [ 4] to investigate how more recent studies differed from the previous ones in the overall effects of the P4P schemes, the effects of study design on the reported effectiveness of the P4P schemes, and the effects of the size of incentives as a percentage of total revenue. A larger number of studies evaluating the effects of P4P helped us to increase the precision of the estimates of the effects in a meta-regression analysis and provided new evidence of changes in effects, study designs, and payment designs.

Their findings suggested that studies with better study designs, such as Difference-in-Differences (DD) designs, had a lower chance of finding a statistically significant effect. They also provided preliminary evidence that the size of incentives as a proportion of revenue may not be associated with the chance of finding a statistically significantly outcome. Method Our method was identical to that used by [ 4].

Studies were included if they examined the effectiveness of a scheme on any type of outcome (e.g., costs, utilization, expenditures, quality of care, health outcomes and if incentives were targeted at individuals or groups of medical practitioners or hospitals). 1 A vote-counting procedure was used to record the proportion of reported effect sizes that were statistically significant (at the 10% level) per study (noting if there were issues of the unit of analysis error and small sample size).2 Some studies examined a range of different outcome indicators, each with a reported effect size (i.e., usually the difference in an outcome indicator between an intervention and control group), while others examined the heterogeneity of effect sizes across time or subgroups of the sample.

A meta-regression analysis was conducted to examine factors associated with the proportion of statistically significant effects in each study, with each published paper as the unit of analysis. A generalized linear model with a logit link function (a fractional logit with a binomial distribution) was used because the dependent variable was a proportion with observations at both extremes of zero and one [ 7]. The error terms would not be independent if there was more than one study evaluating the same scheme, and so standard errors were clustered at the scheme level.

This was calculated from studies that reported both the size of the incentive amount and the provider’s total income or revenue.

This might be due to overall weaker effects from the new studies since none of the new studies examined this type of payment design. Studies evaluating P4P schemes, which rewarded for improvement over time, led to a lower proportion of statistically significant effect sizes. Scott et al. [ 4] found that the use of payments for specific purposes (such as payments for investment quality improvement rather than physician income) was associated with a 24 percentage points increase in the proportion of statistically significant effect sizes, but this has fallen to 8 percentage points (Model 2)", "year": 2021, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

There should be no expectation that incentive designs should necessarily be becoming more complex over time, as this can lead to gaming and ignores the existence of already strong altruistic motives to improve the quality of care. Incentive schemes were also a result of negotiation between providers and payors, and this presented constraints in how incentives were designed.

The “as is” or “de facto” care pathways derived can be analysed together with other data to yield clinical and operational information. It seems likely that the needs of both health systems and patients will lead to increasing application of such analyses. A comprehensive review of the literature is presented, with a focus on the study context, types of analysis undertaken, and the utility of the information gained", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 1117, "text": ". Methods: A systematic review was conducted of literature abstracting sequential patient care activities (“de facto” care pathways) from care records. Broad coverage was achieved by initial screening of a Scopus search term, followed by screening of citations (forward snowball) and references (backwards snowball). Previous reviews of related topics were also considered. Studies were initially classified according to the perspective captured in the derived pathways. Concept matrices were then derived, classifying studies according to additional data used and subsequent analysis undertaken, with regard for the clinical domain examined and the knowledge gleaned. Results: 254 publications were identified. The majority (n = 217) of these studies derived care pathways from data of an administrative/clinical type. 80% (n = 173) applied further analytical techniques, while 60% (n = 131) combined care pathways with enhancing data to gain insight into care processes", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 1118, "text": ". Discussion: Classification of the objectives, analyses and complementary data used in data-driven care pathway mapping illustrates areas of greater and lesser focus in the literature. The increasing tendency for these methods to find practical application in service redesign is explored across the variety of contexts and research questions identified. A limitation of our approach is that the topic is broad, limiting discussion of methodological issues. Conclusion: This review indicates that methods utilising data-driven determination of de facto patient care pathways can provide empirical information relevant to healthcare planning, management, and practice. It is clear that despite the number of publications found the topic reviewed is still in its infancy.

Background Overview In very many healthcare systems around the world, patient care guidance in medical practice is implemented through clinical care pathways [1].

Similar positive outcomes are also proposed for the deployment of electronic health records [4]; together these advances comprise a useful framework for the implementation of evidence-based medicine (EBM). However, there exists a tension between the imperative to best deliver patient-centred care and the necessity for guidance to be clear, memorable, and easily interpretable by clinicians under pressure", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Time spent interacting with the electronic record and referencing guidance is neces - sarily time not spent meaningfully interacting with the patient, but if a care pathway does not take account of a patient’s clinical history and circumstances it will not support personalisation of care. Guidance providers such as UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) attempt to strike a balance, using health economic assessments based on the available data to classify for which patients a treatment is appropriate. The quality of this effort however can only be as good as the evidence base, and in the absence of specific studies on the applicabil - ity of treatment to particular patient groups, assumptions of statistical homogeneity in clinical trials mean that, to quote de Leon: “the current status of RCTs is that they can tell us which treatments are effective but not neces - sarily which patient should receive them” [5]", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1123, "text": ". Particularly in patients with multimorbidity the risks and benefits of treatments may differ [6, 7], and the pressure to practice “defensive medicine” in an increasingly litigious environment [8] and a lack of resources to undertake labourintensive rationalisation of treatment plans [9] compound this problem. The case has also been made that currently defined clinical care pathways may need to be substan - tially restructured, to take advantage of new diagnostic technologies [10]. Responses to these challenges must take into account that a clinical care pathway as defined in [2] above is the “should-be” or formal pathway, a somewhat idealised construct intended to appropriately guide the patient care journey to achieve consistent best practice and optimal patient flow. Variations might arise from this defined pathway appropriately due to clinical acumen or patient complexity, or otherwise through unforeseen circumstances, organisational care boundaries, or devia - tions from guidance", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1124, "text": ". In practice, the sequence of care processes experienced by a cohort of patients comprises a set of “de facto” pathways [11], corresponding in vary - ing degree to the formally defined care pathway. Latterly, there has been increasing interest in applying algorithmic methods to accumulated electronic patient care data to determine these “de facto” care pathways. Patient care process discovery Patient care processes are generally considered particu - larly challenging to describe and model in a realistic and comprehensive fashion. Methodologies for analysing and describing processes have often been derived from man - ufacturing or service industries; where the analysis pro - ceeds from routinely collected data, the procedure used is often referred to as “process mining” . In such contexts, both the environment and the sequence of unit opera - tions performed in the process are highly structured", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1125, "text": ". In such contexts, both the environment and the sequence of unit opera - tions performed in the process are highly structured. Clinical care is likewise delivered in a highly structured environment, but also one that is highly dynamic and extremely complex [12]. The sequence of unit operations performed is often only partially defined, with certain sets of activities following absolute sequencing require - ments (for example, anaesthesia must precede surgery), but which may be scheduled on an ad hoc basis accord - ing to the intervention of a clinician. Other activities such as general nursing care or routine observations may take place on a schedule unrelated to other activities. The inherent diversity of patients and hence care processes adds a further level of complexity to the picture; which may finally be compounded by variability in the quality of the available data, in terms of its granularity, accuracy, and completeness", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1126, "text": ". In response to the challenge of interpreting this com - plex and often incomplete data pool, a broadly similar general procedure is followed. A particular data source is identified, which records some aspect of activities relating to clinical care. Depending on the environment and particular healthcare process being examined, the data may require substantial processing before it is suit - able for use, unless it was collected solely for research or audit purposes: generally, data quality and completeness is a key issue. The types of data that are available for use depend very strongly on the context being explored, but may include include whole or filtered electronic health records, used primarily for clinical care; registries cap - turing care pathway information along with clinical data; or administrative data recorded from Hospital Informa - tion Systems, such as Patient Administration Systems or systems used to generate insurance billing reports", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

With the states representing care activities, this process model can be considered as a representation of a particular per - spective on the aggregated de facto care pathways expe - rienced by the patients in the dataset. The care pathways thus derived need not be linear in nature; iterative or cyclical pathways are common in many clinical domains. The process model often does not describe the entire data set, but only those possible paths through the states with sufficient “support” from the data. Often, some degree of clustering of the data is performed so that similar paths are merged in a consensus path with support from the variations", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

While these topics are frequently present in the research literature, we are unaware of any previous review which has considered these questions in depth. We thus under - took a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 key reporting guideline [14], with such elaborations as were necessary due to the intersectional and evolving nature of the topic.

Comparison of the litera - ture of interest with that review indicated some variation in terminology used, particularly when considering terms present in the title, abstract, and keywords, the search - able content of curated indexed literature databases. We considered that the apparent variation in terminol - ogy used in the literature was characteristic of an emerg - ing intersectional topic, and might be partly attributable to conceptually similar research being reported from different perspectives in journals from very different dis - ciplines. For example, medical specialty journals might focus on the applicability of the methods applied in their clinical context, while computer science journals might place greater emphasis on the specifics of the implemen - tation or the advances in methodology developed", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Given this variation in terminology, exploratory efforts to con - struct search terms adequately capturing the diversity of the literature were only partly successful, and as we felt it would be inappropriate to inadvertently restrict the search to a particular domain the need for a modified approach to literature search was apparent. It has been proposed by Greenhalgh and Peacock [23] that in systematic reviews of complex or heterogeneous evidence in the field of health services research, “snow - ball” methods of forward (citation) and backwards (ref - erence) searching are especially powerful. The approach is likewise recommended for systematic searches of information systems literature [24] and is referred to in PRISMA 2020 [14]. Preliminary experimentation with this methodology yielded positive results: it was there - fore developed as presented below.

The application of the “snowball” search methodology means the main requirement for the initial screened publication set is to achieve a broad representative sampling of the literature rather than complete coverage initially.

The extent to which supplementary techniques have been combined with different types of enhancing data also varies quite substantially. If we consider the two most com - monly applied techniques, conformance analysis and clustering, only 3.5 of the 42.5 publications using con - formance analysis techniques utilise supplementary data other than “guidelines” or “other medical data”; while the supplemental technique of clustering has been applied to every type of enhancing data.

Firstly, there are those publications in which a software package is applied to a dataset, and notable aspects of the derived process model are discussed without substantial use of supplemental techniques.

Conformance analysis Conformance analysis in the context of process mining was defined by Van der Aalst in 2011 [45] as one of the three main forms of process min - ing, utilised where both a pre-existing “process model” and an event log are available. In the particular context of healthcare, the pre-existing “process model” is often a protocol, guideline, or formally defined care pathway, and electronic care records generally take the role of the event log. It is the most commonly applied supplemen - tal technique among the collated publications, although as noted above it has not been frequently combined with enhancing data other than those mentioned.

Six authors in the literature sur - veyed present implementations of discrete event simula - tion derived from patient care process models, though the topic is more frequently referred to in the literature. Tables 15, 16 and 17 below consider some examples from the literature surveyed. Statistical modelling Several publications utilise statistical methods to implement supplementary techniques, as for example in the previously described publications of Nuemi et al.

Descriptive statistics are also commonplace, particularly where resource analysis or conformance analysis is applied. Our defini - tion of statistical modelling as a supplemental technique in its own right is described in Table  7, capturing those publications where the results of statistical analysis are the main output aside from the process model. Relatively few publications can be so classified, less than half of the next most uncommon technique. It may be the case that statistical methods alone tend to serve to develop further methodologies rather than being an end in themselves; certainly, some of the authors below have published quite widely in this field using other techniques.

In the broader context, clinical pathway redesign is increas - ingly data-facilitated if not always data-driven; a good example is the recent well publicised report of Connell et  al.

Unfortu - nately their published evaluation did not analyse derived care pathways before and after implementation, rather simply comparing aggregate outcomes from the old and new pathways. With regard to conceptual assessments of the utility of process mining within healthcare, the recent publications of Dahlin et  al. [140] and Johnson [143] are of interest, taking an overview of the operation of healthcare systems and considering the place of process mining within them. Johnson places process mining as applied to healthcare in the framework of emergent complexity described by General Systems Theory (GST); a holistic and pragmatic approach is emphasised, as “the only real certainty is that data will be different between systems and over time”", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 17, "chunk_id": 1201, "text": ". The challenge is illustrated by the apposite comment that current medical devices are regulated on the basis of being rule based systems, but current developments both in medical AI and system complexity go well beyond those capabilities: GST is proposed to have utility in helping the adjustment to these technologies. Certainly, any theoretical model or framework which could aid the analysis of the decisions made within the complex social and administrative network of healthcare is welcome, particularly in the analysis of data-derived care pathways. Garcia et  al. [144] performed a comparison of an EHR-based logistic regression model of intensive care management referral with thematic analysis of the decisions of the practition - ers involved, finding that while their model had good (c = 0.75) predictive ability “there remain “electronically unmeasured” factors that are important contributors to defining good referral candidates”", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 17, "chunk_id": 1202, "text": ". The existence of such factors must be taken into account if data-driven care pathways are to play a role in formal care pathway redesign. Dahlin et al. also advocates a pragmatic approach to the application of process mining in healthcare informed by current healthcare management practices. Process min - ing is discussed as a complement to the “process map - ping” that is a key component of the discipline of health system Quality Improvement (QI) [145], enabling varia - tion both by location and over time to be captured. The protocol of Litchfield et al. [146] is interesting to note in this context, proposing to explicitly contrast process mining and process mapping of practice at four UK primary care practices. Dahlin et al. reference the 2014 review of Yang and Su to show how limited applications of pro - cess mining in QI have been, an assertion partially borne out by the literature search presented above", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2022_CarePathways_ProcessMining_HealthSystems_Review.pdf", "page": 17, "chunk_id": 1203, "text": ". Certainly, many publications have developed techniques that could readily be used be used to enhance QI, and a number comment on how results have been applied in practice. Nevertheless very few authors develop their work within a formal QI context and we agree with the proposal of Dahlin et al. that “empirical research is needed about how process mining can be integrated into quality improve - ment of patient pathways and healthcare processes”.

Challenges arise in the process of accurately analyzing these raw data. One important challenge to overcome is the accurate classification of study outcomes. For example, using claims data, there is no clear way of classifying hospitalizations due to a specific event. This is because of the inherent disjointedness and lack of context that typically come with raw claims data.

Methods: In this paper, we propose a framework for classifying hospitalizations due to a specific event. We then tested this framework in a private health insurance claims database (Symphony) with approximately 4 million US adults who tested positive with COVID-19 between March and December 2020. Our claims specific COVID-19 related hospitalizations proportion is then compared to nationally reported rates from the Centers for Disease Control by age. Results: Across all ages (18 +) the total percentage of Symphony patients who met our definition of hospitalized due to COVID-19 was 7.3% which was similar to the CDC’s estimate of 7.5%. By age group, defined by the CDC, our estimates vs. the CDC’s estimates were 18–49: 2.7% vs. 3%, 50–64: 8.2% vs. 9.2%, and 65 + : 14.6% vs. 28.1%.

Suc - cessfully using these data in medical research is not an easy task and requires some key considerations [1]. Some of this difficulty comes from the lack of structure and context to how certain International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10, Current Procedural Terminol - ogy (CPT), or drug codes are grouped with one another around an event of interest. For example, a hospitaliza - tion CPT code does not link to the diagnosis code that caused it, nor does the drug code that was prescribed because of the event.

If multiple hospi - talization CPT codes or multiple COVID-19 diagnoses codes occurred for a specific patient, then the minimum distance between all possible combinations of diagnoses and hospitalizations were considered. As a tie breaker the earliest minimum combination which met our criteria was considered as the COVID-19 hospitalization for that specific patient.

BMC Health Services Research (2022) 22:705 methodology seems to capture a percent of the sample similar to that of the CDC estimates. Discussion An extensive literature search identified 32 articles which sought to define events using the Symphony Health database. From these articles a clear pattern emerged. Researchers used these claims data to restructure events using one or more time horizons. This review led us to define a generic methodology which can be used by future researchers hoping to define event specific hos - pitalizations within their own data. In addition, this methodology can easily be adapted to be used for other diseases and medical events. Our methodology is not specific to one database and can be extended to other claims databases as well. While our attempt to validate this method did yield similar findings to the CDC’s esti - mates, no method is without its fair share of limitations", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

While our attempt to validate this method did yield similar findings to the CDC’s esti - mates, no method is without its fair share of limitations. Currently, the Symphony Health Database are not open source or easily available without considerable cost to the researcher, which may stifle an attempt to validate this work. The inherent lack of structure and context in claims data thwart any efforts to know for certain how accurate the methodology truly is. Defining other con - ditional and relevant timelines is a very important step, yet there is no clear way of defining what these should be for a given event. Clinical guidance should determine the time horizon values used in defining overlapping events. Even still, these time horizon values are subject to a mis - understanding of claims data as well as systematic bias in the way claims data are recorded", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Recommendations for replicating this work The framework outlined in this manuscript is purposely generic so to be as useful across, what is, a diverse land - scape of available claims data. We have several rec - ommendations for replicating this framework in the readers own claims data. The researcher should first start by understanding the basic structure of the claims data available to them. For example, some claims datasets contain information batched on the claim level (what diagnoses, procedures, prescriptions happened dur - ing a timeline) or can be presented individually and not batched together at the claim level. The Symphony data available to us, for this paper, was separate non-batched data. Sometimes claims data contain what seem to be duplicate records which will need special considera - tion or rules on how to address them (example: remove duplicates or consider as separate events)", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Considering the characteristics and definition of the event of inter - est, the researcher may first define relevant conditional event horizons in the framework meant to validate that the event really did happen. For example, if mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 is an event of interest, a conditional event horizon between hospitalization and mechanical ventilation may be added to Fig.  2. Any other available data (example: inpatient, admission data) that the researcher has for the patient could be used for refin - ing the event of interest or validating the event (exam - ple: prescribed medication, or surgical procedures). Some claims data have diagnosis codes ranked (prin - cipal, secondary, …). If available, this rank can be used to strengthen the event reconstruction strategy.

If discrepancies exist between the framework estimates and the external benchmark this could be due to the errors in the recon - struction strategy or a bias in the available claims data. Researchers should be aware that claims data typically contain temporal aberrations which should be built into event reconstruction timelines. For example, it is possi - ble that in the claims timeline it shows a hospital admit - tance on November 1st, and a COVID-19 diagnosis the following day on November 2nd. Whether these events are close enough to be considered tied together is up to the researcher and their personal event reconstruction strategy.

With increased demand for healthcare access, surgeons and administrators seek new ways to expand capacity while maintaining high quality care. Expanded capacity is often limited by physician time and clinical space, which utilizes healthcare system resources. In addition, unnecessary clinical visits are a potential inefficiency for patients as in person visits can require an investment of time and travel, lost productivity from work, thus incurring expense [4 ]. As carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel release are performed frequently, we designed a post-operative pathway to eliminate unnecessary visits by providing detailed instructions (verbal and written) pre-operatively and allowing patients to choose asneeded follow-up after surgery. * Brian C", "year": 2022, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

All Veterans Affairs (VA) patients ≥ 18  years of age who underwent an elective carpal tunnel release (CTR), cubital tunnel release (CuTR), or both simultaneously were eligible for the FCP. During their pre-operative visit, patients were given the choice of either CFU or Flexible Care Pathway for their post-operative care. The patients who chose CFU were scheduled to return to clinic for a post-operative visit within two weeks after the procedure. The patients who chose FCP were not scheduled to come back to clinic, but had the option to call or schedule an appointment should any concerns arise (Fig.  1). Preoperatively, a detailed post-operative care packet was reviewed with and given to patients irrespective of the followup path chosen. This packet included photos of the typical healing progression, written information about details of the post-operative course (e.g., pain, incision care, activity, diet, and warning signs), as well as clinic and on-call contact information", "year": 2022, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

Discussion Alternative forms of communication for outreach have the potential to improve patient access, avoid patient travel, and reduce health care costs. Postoperative care with telemedicine or specialized digital applications have been designed to reduce the onus on patients and providers [8 , 9]. Telemedicine in upper extremity and hand surgery has been proven to mitigate travel burden, especially to those in remote or underserved areas. Similar to our study, Buvik et al. per - formed a randomized control trial of approximately 400 orthopedic consultations and found that video consultations were equivalent in safety, reduce travel associated with traditional clinic visits, and are superior in patient satisfaction [9].

Patient travel times and costs are a significant factor in our veteran population with a mean travel mileage of 115 miles. This would incur an estimated $66.49 per patient in travel expenses. As distance of travel to Veteran Affair (VA) hospitals has been shown to make it difficult for veterans to obtain specialty care, a method to reduce unnecessary travel while still receiving quality care in the veteran cohort is paramount [10, 11]. This study evaluated a Flexible Care Pathway in a Veteran population where, depending on disability level, typical copays range from zero to very little out of pocket expense to veterans and transportation costs are often reimbursed [12]. In a non-VA population, a flexible care option may be of even more value to the patient, who would likely pay a larger co-pay and incur full travel expenses. However, a non-VA patient may not be required to travel as far for their routine health care needs", "year": 2022, "topics": ["telemedicine"], "category": "technology"}

Giving patients the option to follow-up reduces the utilization of time or resources of making follow-up visits, which this study effectively shows are unnecessary in 75% of this population. Since patients can choose their followup pathway, FCP gives patients greater autonomy to make healthcare better fit their needs, whether it is a flexible or conventional follow-up visit.

There have been majo r diﬀerences in the responses and performance of national healthcare systems to the pandemic, and there is a need to thoroughly explore the roots of these variations. The ﬁnancing model is a distinguishing feature of any healthcare system. Despite the strong criticism of the out-of-pocket payment model that is common in Low-t o-Middle Income Countries [LMICs; ( 1)], the performance of other models of healthcare systems in managing the pandemic is not necessarily superior ( 2). Surprisingly, recent attempts to examine the technical eﬃciency of healthcare systems suggest that a number of LMICs are outperforming those in developed economies ( 3). The current pandemic represents a unique opportunity to explore whether the variation in the performance of healthcare systems to the pandemic is due to the healthcare ﬁnancing model, or whether other factors have a greater inﬂuence on performance ( 4)", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

It indicates that patients and managers should ﬁrst focus on the capacity of medical service providers when making a choice or deciding how to use the results of the DRGs system ( Zou et al.). Li et al. collected data from 3,098 A-share companies in 2019 and 2020. They applied the Z-score model to reasonably evaluate enterprise ﬁnancial risk, and analyzed the impact of Research and Development (R&D) investment on enterprise ﬁnancial risk under COVID-19. Their ﬁndings have revealed that the pandemic has increased the number of high-risk enterprises. R&D investment appears to be able to eﬀectively reduce an enterprise’s ﬁnancial risk, and enterprises that attach importance to scientiﬁc research are relatively less aﬀected by COVID-19. Compared with non-state-owned enterprises, R&D investment under state-owned enterprises can better help enterprises reduce ﬁnancial risk. When the enterprise’s ﬁnancial risk is lower, the role of R&D investment in reducing ﬁnancial risk is more signiﬁcant", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

An intriguing study came discusses Romania in eastern Europe, presenting a post-Semashko health system model. These authors tested working hypotheses using an econometric linear regression model based on the ﬁnancing budgetary function, which matches funding to the speciﬁc need for each expenditure heading. The authors concluded that under the impact of pandemic stress, measures to improve healthcare management, increase performance and streamline ﬁnancial allocation are vulnerable and cannot counteract the eﬀects that the pandemic has on the healthcare of the population as reﬂected by the morbidity and mortality indicators collected during the pandemic ( Antohi et al.)", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Emerging BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) countries, marked by long-term bold real GPD growth ( 5), are the strongest global drivers of supply and demand for medical goods, generic pharmaceuticals, and services outside wealthy OECD nations. The lockdowns triggered by the pandemic have strongly impacted airborne, naval, and land trade routes and ground supply chains among the major nations ( 6). The Global South’s LMICs countries, many of which are represented in this Research Topic, present a huge diversity in terms of the historical legacy of their medical care ﬁnancing and provision patterns ( 7). An array of clinical post-COVID-19 syndromes have worsened the burden of premature mortality and absenteeism attributable to chronic non-communicable diseases ( 8).

The Global South’s health systems face diﬃcult sustainability issues, driven by these underlying patterns ( 9, 10). Their health system ineﬃciencies are becoming increasingly extended to the limits of resilience ( 5). Recent seminal evidence has documented that most of the supplies necessary for addressing COVID-19 and intensive care originate from China and other South-East Asian (ASEAN) nations ( 11). The goal of this Research Topic was to explore the impact of ﬁnancing on the readiness of diﬀerent healthcare systems to respond to emergencies ( 12). Health policy considerations were primarily focused on ﬁnancing mechanisms and healthcare system response ( 13). The editors believe that these heterogeneous contributions have opened new debates.

To this end, health information systems have been implemented in hospitals, with this implementation representing progress in medicine and information technologies. As a result, life expectancy has signiﬁcantly increased, standards in healthcare have been raised, and public health has improved. This progress is inﬂuenced by the process of managing healthcare organizations and information systems. While hospitals tend to adapt health information systems to reduce errors related to patient misidentiﬁcation, the rise in the occurrence and recording of medical errors in Lebanon resulting from failures to correctly identify patients reveals that such measures remain insufﬁcient due to unknown factors. This research aimed to investigate the effect of health information systems (HISs) and other factors related to work-related conditions on reductions in patient misidentiﬁcation and related consequences.

Introduction The emergence of information technologies in healthcare offers an important means to improving services in healthcare organizations. Patient safety in healthcare is a critical issue that has yet to be adequately addressed despite continued attempts [1]. Patient safety is a division of healthcare described as the mitigation and prevention of adverse healthcare outcomes or injuries. The evolution of information technology has inﬂuenced the healthcare sector, playing a vital role in patient safety [2,3]. In the literature on patient safety, patient care information systems (PCISs) are regarded as one of the main components of a safe healthcare system [4,5]. Information technology in healthcare has been described as “the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software for the collection, retrieval, sharing and use of healthcare information” [ 6]. Some of these results can be triggered by the introduction of electronic health records", "year": 2022, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Additionally, these programs have demonstrated a capacity to minimize medical errors and enhance patient safety, reduce adverse drug reactions, and strengthen compliance with practice guidelines, such as through the facilitation of access to patient data, testing support, and the greater completeness and comprehensiveness of documentation [7]. In 2000, the study “To Err is Human” by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) called for the development and testing of new technologies to minimize medical errors [ 8], and a subsequent report from 2001, “Crossing the Quality Chasm”, called for the use of information technology as a crucial ﬁrst step in improving and developing healthcare systems to achieve better and safer treatment [9]", "year": 2022, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Health information technology includes multiple tools ranging from simple charting to more sophisticated decision support and medical technology integrations. The employment of information technologies in the health sector can help increase the value of healthcare delivery, improve patient safety, reduce medical errors, and strengthen patient-to-healthcare provider engagement. A health information system is a data management system for healthcare. It includes systems that capture, store, maintain, and distribute the electronic medical records of patients, systems for the organizational management of hospitals, or decision-making systems that support healthcare policy. Thus, HISs help organizations improve data management and, hence, patients’ health while supporting decision making and the achievement of better results", "year": 2022, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

HISs make it possible to move from paper-based to computer-based data processing when using data for planning and research and to involve patients as HIS users along with healthcare professionals and hospital administrations [10,11]. In addition, health information systems also provide those systems that handle data related to providers’ and health organizations’ activities. These may be leveraged as an integrated initiative to improve patient outcomes, contribute to analyses, and inﬂuence policy making and decision making. The safety of data is a primary concern since health information systems typically access, process, or retain large volumes of sensitive data. Health information technology involves the development of health information systems that assist in the collection, storage, and analysis of health data to help monitor the health of a population and the cost of healthcare.

Patient safety mirrors healthcare quality, including ensuring harmless service [ 13] through the correct identiﬁcation of patients [14], as misidentiﬁcation can cause harm due incorrect medical treatments or diagnoses [15]. Fortunately, the techniques and solutions available can help to reduce the risk of patient misidentiﬁcation through the employment of a health information system (HIS) that standardizes patient identiﬁcation approaches and spreads a culture of patient safety via its use to implement and apply policies.

A study was conducted comparing the old applied system and the HIS over two consecutive years each. Lebanon has recently experienced the most complex crisis relating to several sectors in its entire modern history. Thus, on top of the economic and ﬁnancial crisis that started in October 2019, two other major negative events were superimposed: the health crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating explosion in the Port of Beirut in August 2020.

Improvements in patient safety require a comprehensive system-wide initiative involving a wide range of performance enhancement steps, environmental safety, and risk management, including infection control, safe use of medications, the safety of facilities, and safe clinical practice and a safe healthcare environment. Following the Institute of Medicine study entitled “To Err is Human: Creating a Safer Health System” [ 8], patient safety in healthcare organizations has gained much attention. The researchers state that if there is a safety culture in which adverse events can be reported without blaming people, they have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and improvements can be made to prevent future human and system errors, thereby promoting patient safety [8].", "year": 2022, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

As health information exchange has grown over the last decade, with the healthcare industry aiming to decrease costs, improve interoperability, and shift to a patient-centric care delivery paradigm, this objective has become more important [25]. Patient-centric health systems and processes require strong information governance that ensures the integrity of patient identity and precise patient matching. Organizations should manage patient identiﬁcation systems as an ongoing process, from front-end data capture to back-end quality control [25]. High-quality healthcare is impossible without patient safety, which means that patients should not suffer any health-related harm [13].

Patient misidentiﬁcation can occur in different areas, such as drug administration, surgeries, and blood transfusion [26], resulting in incorrect diagnoses, treatments, identiﬁcation of pathologies, or sample collection [15]. Human and administrative errors can have effects on other factors in hospitals, including workload, nurse fatigue, the culture of patient safety, and implementation of patient identiﬁcation policy. Workload inﬂuences nurses’ performance in terms of tasks and time, which in turn can affect patient safety [27,28]. Nurse fatigue is reﬂected in nurses’ tiredness [29].

The data collected through the survey for this study included the years 2018–2019, after an HIS was introduced in the hospital. The implementation of an HIS is an important change in the operating environment of a hospital and, hence, the measurement of the potentially related factors covered the period after the introduction of the HIS. In testing the relationship between patient misidentiﬁcation and both the HIS adoption and the other factor components, the following results were obtained (Table 14). Table 14.

Conclusions The healthcare sector is a difﬁcult and delicate place to work in that involves dealing with customers, patients’ suppliers, colleagues, guarantors, and the latest developments, in addition to the daily problems and difﬁculties that need special treatment, and as all of these seem to be big challenges, it is sometimes hard to keep a positive attitude,.", "year": 2022, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Today’s technologies will change at a rapid pace; therefore, a long-term solution must include the system’s ability to evolve without causing unacceptable disruption. The proposed framework is a method that may be used to evaluate ideas for the enhancement of patient identiﬁcation in terms of resolving the most important stakeholder issues, which are not often expressed directly as non-functional requirements. Government agencies (e.g., health departments, health district management), NGOs (e.g., the WHO, standards bodies, etc.), and even HIS vendors may be end-consumers of this framework", "year": 2022, "topics": ["health-information-systems"], "category": "health-informatics"}

The implementation of the HIS revolutionized the operating contexts of the Neioumazloum Hospital and the healthcare sector in Lebanon by providing a platform for better service, as its use reduces errors in hospitals. Moreover, healthcare managers can make decisions regarding HISs based on this research. As the adoption of HIS requires government support, ﬁnancial resources, the enthusiasm of top management, and acceptance of doctors and nurses [ 81,84–89], this research offers additional incentives in favor of the introduction of HISs in hospitals.

We learned that PEPFAR-supported EMRs were not widely used for COVID-19 surveillance of HIV patients in the study countries. COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient care were usually provided at govern - ment-designated care units or private healthcare facilities that do not share health records with HIV care facilities. The failure to longitudinally share medical records is multifactorial. COVID-19 EMRs, where available, were usually standalone systems that lacked the ability to interact with national in - teroperability platforms to enable data exchange in support of clinical decision making ( 14). Therefore, clinicians at most COVID-19 care units did not have access to HIV-related patient risk factor information. Figure 2.

With the ever-increasing quantities of data that are digitally collected and stored within healthcare organizations, there is a growing enthusiasm in the potential applications for Big Data analytics in the ﬁelds of diagnostics, precision medicine, computerized decision support for clinicians, pharmacological research aiming to cure diseases and develop new treatments, the early detection of adverse drug reactions, cost reduction in patient care, preventive medicine, and population health research [4]. At the same time, the term Real-World Data (RWD) is commonly used to describe data derived from sources other than traditional randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). These sources may include EHRs, pragmatic clinical trials, prospective or retrospective observational studies, health insurance claims, case reports, data obtained as part of routine public health surveillance, product and disease registries, patient surveys, or other realworld sources [5]", "year": 2022, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

In the last few years, a consensus has formed that RWD offer valuable opportunities for generating robust clinical evidence (i.e., real-world evidence) regarding the use and potential beneﬁts or harms of new therapies outside the context of RCTs [8,9]. Researchers typically understand RWD as observational data, distinct from data sourced from RCTs, and in a way similar to Big Data.

Recent methodological advancements have made causal inferences from Big Data possible and, in certain cases, are highly effective in replicating the results of RCTs that are made available later [14,15].

Ten themes were identified in care coordination in PHC/primary care. Four themes under care coordination at the individual level were the continuity of services, linkage at different stages of health conditions (from health promotion to rehabilitation), health care from a life-course (conception to elderly), and care coordination of health services at places (family to hospitals). Five themes under organizational level care coordination included interprofessional, multidisciplinary services, community collaboration, integrated care, and information in care coordination.

Conclusions Continuity and coordination of care involve healthcare provisions from family to health facility throughout the life-course to provide a range of services. Several issues could influence multilevel care coordination, including at the individual (services or users), organizational (providers), and system (departments and sectors) levels. Health systems should focus on care coordination, ensuring types of care per the healthcare needs at different stages of health conditions by a multidisciplinary team. Coordinating multiple technical and supporting stakeholders and sectors within and beyond health sector is also vital for the continuity of care especially in resource-limited health systems and settings.

Care coordination ensures people-centred care, cover - ing discrete healthcare events experienced by people as coherent and interconnected over time, consistent with their health needs and preferences, bringing and meeting health needs and ensuring integrated care [7]. Further - more, care coordination refers to interprofessional care, patient-centred care, self-management support, preven - tion, screening, primary care, and treatment of illnesses [8, 9]. Other features of health care coordination include multidisciplinary services, establishing cooperative and ongoing relationships, and delivering multiple health services (e.g., case management of all stages of disease), especially for people with multiple morbidities [7, 10]", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Moreover, healthcare coordination or continuity care can be explained as informational continuity (commu - nication among providers), relational (provider-patient relationship, team-driven continuity), and management continuity (activities for systems and service organizations) [11, 12]. This informational and relational care coordination occurs at the individual and organisational level for relationship, communication and cooperation between providers and users [1 , 13]. The level of stakehold - ers engagement in care coordination/continuity of care depends on the hierarchical and interdependent rela - tionship in the context of time and setting of health sys - tems [6].

Chronic care systems, lessons and resources were leveraged to support people with HIV-negative with chronic NCDs [66]. Care of chronic diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and diabetes) found continuity of clinical management, such as distribution of care across levels and rapid access and referral to reduce future hospitalisations and long-term diabetic complication admissions [64, 72].

System-level care coordination is essential for health service management (ensuring inputs and facilitating processes) towards the delivery of services. Multisecto - ral coordination for health service management worked based on a shared philosophy, financial considerations, leadership strategies, power, and hierarchy [42, 57]. Multiple sectors were involved at the management level for collaborative health policy/planning and funding, community engagement, private sector engagement (to provide specialized care), building health workforce, and system changes across services and settings [36, 50, 55, 63]. Higher level system integration (governments, NGOs, donors, and international agencies) was dedicated to reimbursement redesign, improvement of data systems and sharing capability towards cooperation resources [28, 45, 61]", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Furthermore, at the community level, the health committee enhanced the sectoral coordination for authority and resources from governments and sup - porting agencies [35]. Furthermore, collaborative efforts within the health system for care coordination included planning for systemic and healthcare training needs, cre - ating a resilient health system for anticipating and adapt - ing to adverse situations, scaling up screening through health caravans, task-shifting, and introducing job aids for providers [76, 77, 79]. Additionally, coordination and collaboration with other sectors in health enhanced shared vision, advocating for public health policy, mobi - lizing faith-based organizations, codeveloped plans for implementation and evaluation, resource alignment, structures, and financial incentives [32, 38]", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Leadership, administrative support, responsibility for coordination, accountability, building relationships with care partners, and external factors (e.g., culture, hierarchy, regulations, finance, and communication technology) [29, 34, 37, 62]. Multisectoral collaboration improved resources for organizational capacity, collaborative planning, support - ive governance, and public health legislation to tackle social determinants of health by mandating the role of local governments and institutionalizing PHC services [36, 47]. Implementing and maintaining collaboration between partners, and organizational leaders needed to identify shared priorities, joint reflection and adaptation, shared decisions, achieving tangible benefits, realisation of sustained relationships, clearly defined structures, shared visions of care, team development, optimal use of resources, and collaborative approaches to programs and services [32, 38, 44, 45]", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2023_CareCoordination_Continuity_PrimaryCare_ScopingReview.pdf", "page": 9, "chunk_id": 1558, "text": ". System-level challenges (administrative, organizational, structural, and relational), the lack of standard measures and administrative data hindered the capacity of health pro - viders to ensure continuity of care [40, 49, 63]. For example, in Brazil, essential attributes influencing care coordina - tion were fragmentation of the regional network, inherent problems in PHC, and poor coordination capacity [36]. In Australia, Medicare Locals and Primary Health Networks reported limited time and financial support for cooperation with the local government due to the inadequate collaborative capacity of local organizations in tackling issues [47]. Discussion This scoping review identified health care coordination at the individual, organizational and system levels.

BMC Health Services Research (2023) 23:750 Care coordination at the individual level focuses on individuals with specific health needs across the life course and places which requires coordination of dif - ferent levels of services (e.g., preventive to rehabilita - tive care). The care coordination model at the individual level can enable the safety net of primary care/PHC for individuals by building relationships with care provid - ers, supporting patients, and facilitating the development and evaluation of existing and new care models for health needs, settings and life-course perspectives [29, 62]. For example, promotive interventions (such as lifestyle modifications and behaviour change) could promote people’s health and well-being. In contrast, interventions related to screening can identify high-risk populations and early diagnosis of illnesses [7 ]", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

In contrast, interventions related to screening can identify high-risk populations and early diagnosis of illnesses [7 ]. The health coordination links various health services from prevention to treatment of disease conditions [30]. Detection, treatment, and reha - bilitation are approaching the disease progression and needs, which can be delivered in different settings [42]. For example, preventive services can be delivered at the home while screening services at the community level, and screening and treatment services can be received at the facility settings [12, 54, 81]. Coordination of care across settings permits integrating services to address the patient’s and family’s comprehensive needs that can result in efficiency (e.g., decreased healthcare costs, fragmented care, and improvement in care practices) [82]. Organizational care coordination involves multidisci - plinary providers and services, vital for supplying inte - grated care (public health and primary health care)", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Professional training and cultural competency are essen - tial for new or existing service collaborations [27, 44, 53]. The PHC workforce can improve access to and qual - ity health care services [55]. Developing a care pathway across the hospitals led to using existing and newly con - structed structures and data monitoring [83]. Current health systems and model of care focuses on primary care on treating illnesses but less focus on health prometon and prevention. Such disease-focused models cannot meet individual and community health needs; instead, they require people-centred integrated health services to address changing epidemiological and demo - graphic shifts. For instance, children and youth with spe - cial health care needs require interfacing multiple care systems (home care agencies, advocacy groups, allied health services) and professionals (medical, social, and behavioural), and families [82]", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Multidisciplinary services provided through interpro - fessional collaboration could meet the changing burden of diseases and emerging health needs of the population by integrating public health interventions focusing on health and conditions [84]. Additionally, technological advances can be driving forces for transforming primary care to reach disadvantaged populations [84]. For exam - ple, family health (interdisciplinary team) can provide various care options for health service delivery in pub - lic health emergencies by ensuring infection control, coordination, antiviral medication, clinical care, nursing services, and communication strategies [85]. In addi - tion, the community health workers approach can bring patient-centred infrastructure and resourcing, unique liaison capacity for people, communities, and health facilities, and evolving care continuum across patient ages to promote health equity and reduce the cost of care [86]", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Furthermore, information in the continuity of care is best suited to manage the relational continuity among multidisciplinary providers and integrated care. There - fore, organisational efforts are needed to consider the broader fit for the provider’s local responsiveness [69]. Within the health system, it is vital to ensure coordina - tion of departments/units in the organizations to provide and deliver health services. For example, organizations’ finance, administration, and logistic teams play essential roles in the organization of services. These units play a supporting role in providing and delivering health ser - vices and facilitate the health care coordination for the organisations, providers, and service users.

Addition - ally, the role of multiple stakeholders has an indirect impact on health services. Coordinating multiple sectors (health and non-health) and stakeholders (governments, non-government, private sector) are the backbones of resource mobilization, health planning and health sys - tem governance. A broader system-level collaboration is required to mobilise resources for better health planning and management of health services [47, 48, 55]. Interorganizational care coordination suggests that partners’ efforts to align their coordination domains can improve health care delivery [87]. This study provided some insights into care coordina - tion at different levels. Firstly, care coordination con - ceptualizes health services and providers at individual, organisation and system levels and intersects at three levels", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Secondly, the delivery of health services requires according to the health conditions; for instance, the early stage of disease progression requires health pro - motion, followed by prevention, screening, treatment and rehabilitation. Thirdly, implementing interpersonal or multidisciplinary collaboration requires relational and informational continuity among the providers and services within the health facilities. Fourthly, manage - ment continuity is more incredible within and beyond the health system to ensure continuous provision and delivery of health services [69]. Finally, care coordina - tion is widely accepted and discussed in HICs primarily focusing on hospital primary care and care. However, it is imperative that LMICs also require to focus on research", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Conclusions Care coordination involves health care providers in the course of disease progression, life course perspectives and places of care (family to health facilities). The care coordination/continuity of care conceptualises from the lens of utilization of services, health conditions-specific services to individuals, delivery of health services col - laborating with multiple professionals or multiple ser - vices, and management of health services with support from other non-health departments, stakeholders within health systems and beyond", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Several issues influence the care coordination at the individual (services or users), organizational (health care settings where ranges of pro - viders are working) and system levels (where organisa - tions and sectors involve in care coordination). Health system efforts focus on care coordination, ensuring types of care per the healthcare needs at different stages of health conditions by multidisciplinary professionals and coordinating multiple technical and supporting stake - holders and sectors within the health systems.

Methods In accordance with the PRISMA guideline, a broad electronic search of all literature was conducted on the topic through six databases, including PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Embase to 25 July 2022. The inclusion criteria were to select English‑written articles available in full text with the closest objec‑ tives. 36 articles were selected for further analysis. Results Interoperability has been raised in the field of health information systems from 2003 and now it is one of the topics of interest to researchers. The projects done in this field are mostly in the national scope and to achieve the electronic health record.

HL7 FHIR, CDA, HIPAA and SNOMED‑CT, SOA, RIM, XML, API, JAVA and SQL are among the most important requirements for implementing interoperability. In order to guarantee the concept of data exchange, semantic interaction is the best choice because the systems can recognize and process semantically similar informa‑ tion homogeneously. Conclusions The health industry has become more complex and has new needs. Interoperability meets this needs by communicating between the output and input of processor systems and making easier to access the data in the required formats.

The benefits of health institutions adopting health information systems are apparent.

A hospital’s medical information are not interchangeable and accessible to another health institu - tion. In a given situation, the health professional does not have access to the whole of the patient’s medical information unless the patient is conscious and can provide the information that the health professional requires to make an informed and individualized decision on the best course of action at the time [7]. To make an informed decision on which procedures to follow, a healthcare professional needs access to information distributed across various institutions. If an institution makes an error due to a lack of information, overcoming the problem will be more difficult, if not impossible. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop integration mechanisms among the various health information systems to allow for ubiq - uitous access to patient health information [8]", "year": 2023, "topics": ["health-information-systems", "interoperability"], "category": "health-informatics"}

The sharing of information among different levels of healthcare has a link to the quality, efficiency, and safety of care provided to a patient. The ability of systems to connect and exchange information with each other, in either implementation or access, without limitation refers to interoperability [9]. The interoperability between health information systems is of utmost importance and essential for a better health service management, public health, quality and safety of care to patients and clinical research. The lack of interoperability leads to redundant, disorganized, disjointed and inaccessible medical infor - mation, that may affect the quality of care provided to patients and waste of financial resources [10].

PRISMA aims to help authors improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

These levels include: • Technical interoperability At this level of interop - erability, data is exchanged across systems using a communication protocol. At the plug-and-play, sig - nal, and protocol levels, technical interoperability establishes harmonization. • Syntactic interoperability Is the capacity of two or more systems to share data and services using a common interoperability protocol like the High Level Architecture [24]. • Pragmatic interoperability When interoperating systems are aware of one other’s processes and pro - cedures; this level of interoperability is attained", "year": 2023, "topics": ["health-information-systems", "interoperability"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Consequently, even if their instances are heterogeneously repre - sented, that is if they are differently structured and/ or use different terminology or natural language, the systems can recognize and process semantically similar information homogeneously. Semantic inter - operability is distinguished from the other levels of interoperability because it assures that the receiving system understands the meaning of the sent infor - mation, even if the receiving system’s algorithms are unknown to the sending system.

Sometimes this acquisition is funded by the healthcare system, but the key question is how the system leverages this acquisition and ultimately how it translates into patient care. This study seeks to explore nurses’ key competencies acquired through continuing education from the perspective of two groups of postgraduate nurses with different levels of experience and with different objectives to be assessed. An NGT procedure was applied to the group discussion. The participants were recruited according to basic factors such as the number of years of professional experience, their level of education, and their preferred professional status. Thus, seventeen professionals participated in the study, representing two public hospitals in the city. Following the NGT procedure, the competencies identiﬁed from the thematic analysis were scored and ranked to achieve a consensus", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Following the NGT procedure, the competencies identiﬁed from the thematic analysis were scored and ranked to achieve a consensus. Eight core issues were derived in the novel group concerning transferring the competencies to patient care quality: holism, care work, organizational barriers, specialization, no transfer, conﬁdence, knowledge, and instrumental tools. Four core issues were derived when asked about the relationship between the resources invested and the organizational and professional development of the nursing staff: professional development, positive learning, negative learning, and recognition. In the more experienced group, seven issues were derived from the ﬁrst issue raised: continuous learning, quality, conﬁdence, holism, safe care, autonomy, and technical issues. Additionally, six issues arose from the second question: satisfaction, autonomy, creativity, productivity, professional development, and recognition", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Governments seem to devote a large portion of public funds to the training of these professionals, but the question remains: to what extent does this investment in continuous training reach the patient, and does the system allow professionals (nurses) to apply it? The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the shortcomings, in Spain and throughout Europe, in the surveillance ﬁeld and how difﬁcult it is to manage a health crisis without a robust management model of public health [1]. The need for lifelong learning for the nursing community that allows them to acquire holistic knowledge and skills is increasing in Int. J. Environ. Res.

Nurses have a responsibility to keep up to date on their skills and competencies, but institutions must provide adequate structure and support. The institutional culture must value training as an investment and, in this sense, must promote an environment conducive to learning, which in turn must facilitate the professional development of nurses and, with it, improve their care for patients and for the organization. In the period 2020–2022, the activity of nursing professionals increased in complexity and difﬁculty; together with more demanding patients, this has led to dissatisfaction, stress, and exhaustion. With all certainty, this trend will continue during the coming years", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2023_Nurse_Competencies_Healthcare_Performance.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1668, "text": ". With all certainty, this trend will continue during the coming years. Society must assume responsibility for the importance of healthcare provision to these professionals, which should imply increasing ﬁnancial resources for the profession and reducing the barriers encountered by nurses, e.g., in aspects related to fewer opportunities for continuous training by their organizations, the high cost of training, loss of motivation, shortage of staff, family issues, and limited involvement of management teams. Consequently, nurses must understand the relationship between the acquisition of competencies through continuous learning and the improvement of patient care and professional practice. 2. Background 2.1. Competencies in Nursing Competence is deﬁned in a variety of ways. Many professions have their core competencies. Nursing competency includes the crucial abilities required for fulﬁlling one’s role as a nurse", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2023_Nurse_Competencies_Healthcare_Performance.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1669, "text": ". Many professions have their core competencies. Nursing competency includes the crucial abilities required for fulﬁlling one’s role as a nurse. Therefore, it is important to clearly deﬁne nursing competency to establish a foundation for the nursing education curriculum. However, while the concepts surrounding nursing competency are important for improving nursing quality, they are still not yet completely developed. In [2], the authors deﬁne nursing competencies as: “the habitual and judicious use of communication, knowledge, technical skills, clinical reasoning, emotions, values, and reﬂection in daily practice for the beneﬁt of the individual and community being served”. According to a review of the international literature on nursing, competency can follow three theoretical approaches: behaviorism, trait theory, and holism [3]. Behaviorism refers to competency as the ability to perform individual core skills", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2023_Nurse_Competencies_Healthcare_Performance.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1670, "text": ". Behaviorism refers to competency as the ability to perform individual core skills. Trait theory considers competency as the individual traits necessary for effectively performing duties. Holism views competency as a cluster of elements, including knowledge, skills, attitudes, thinking ability, and values required in certain contexts, including professional judgment. We use in this study the holistic view used by [4], who developed the clinical nursing competence self-assessment scale (CNCSS) that considers four competency concepts: (1) basic nursing abilities, (2) the ability to provide care that addresses individual needs, (3) the ability to modify the care environment and collaboration systems, and (4) the ability to devote time toward professional development in nursing practice", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2023_Nurse_Competencies_Healthcare_Performance.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1671, "text": ". The three theoretical approaches complement each other as they go from individual skills to performing duties to taking a step further to a global (holistic) concept in which aspects related to professional development, continuous learning, risk management, or nursing care management are included. It is this last aspect that we have focused on in this study. In Spain, there is no obligation to take a given number of hours of continuous learning once the nursing professional has obtained their degree. However, in some regions, a climate has been created that favors continuous learning with an accrediting legislative system, supported by the consideration of the time of attendance at training courses organized by the social partners as working time [5]", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Although the authors show the lack of reliable data on access to and participation in training courses, the study concludes that nurses have great interest in continuous education and professional development.

It is clear that the literature that analyzes the competencies acquired through lifelong learning after graduation is inconclusive and scarce when it comes to transferring this to quality and organizational aspects. Previous research shows how the investment in continuing education does not translate into the health system taking advantage of it to improve the quality of care for the patient; it remains an acquisition of competencies that the health professional uses personally without being supported by the health organization, despite the fact that in many cases it is the health system itself that ﬁnanced this continuing education.

[8] investigates, from a qualitative point of view, the perception of nurses about the impact of lifelong learning on patient care and competency acquisition.

Studies that measured the impact on care practice seem to establish a causal relationship between lifelong learning and care. However, [9] concludes that, although the medical institutions showed conﬁdence in the relationships among core competencies, continuous training, and care practice, in more than 35% of studies the measurement instruments are not always valid or reliable, so we must take the conclusions with some caution.

Aim Our purpose is to characterize, as a ﬁrst step, the utility, the impact on patients and institutions, and the inﬂuence of the competencies acquired in a holistic sense in the continuous learning after graduation. In the academic ﬁeld of nursing in Spain, nurses ﬁnish their degrees and begin to take a series of courses in a more or less impulsive or reﬂective way. This is maintained throughout their professional life, with ups and downs determined by work, family, or personal issues. Such courses and seminars are sometimes funded by the national health system, and at other times the nurses are privately funded. This study describes nurses’ experience of working as members of different unit practices in two public hospitals in Aragon (Spain).

Our study set out to gain a deeper understanding of the lived experience of a group of nurses working in two public hospitals. The global research question is: What is the effect of nurses’ lifelong learning (in terms of competencies acquisition) on healthcare organizations’ performance? The following research questions were proposed to fulﬁll this goal: Is it possible to transfer competencies acquisition to patient care quality? Is the system capable of harnessing that potential for its own beneﬁt? The results are used to highlight and offer some practical reﬂections about public/private investment in lifelong programs and to balance their purposes. 3.

However, there is a climate of dissatisfaction, since training serves only to obtain more points and to consolidate jobs, but in no case does the system evaluate or enable mechanisms to transfer all this intellectual capital to the hospital environment. Given this situation, a group of nurses from one of the hospitals analyzed was concerned about analyzing in greater depth the reasons for these aspects. A descriptive qualitative design was chosen to better understand the subjects of the research questions from the perspective of the nurses themselves (and other process stakeholders).

The least valued skills are those related to institutional support because, although it generates uneven growth in terms of professional development, the impossibility of applying what they have learned in their daily practice and of developing and applying other skills learned is a drawback, encountering barriers at the institutional level, from senior management, and from colleagues. Continuing education has contributed nothing, in many cases, due to its poor quality, and the fact that it does not expand or supplement academic training, so it is considered solely as an expense. The public health system in Spain is perceived to be of high quality, while those organizations offering online courses are regarded as being of poor quality.

In the least experienced group, continuous training serves to improve indicators of optimization of time and resources and encourage research in care as well as developing more efﬁcient care (results). However, it was observed that there is no correlation between the improvement of patient care (results) and professional development because the institution considers only the number of courses taken as a quality indicator to improve its position when choosing certain clinical units, so quality indicators of the use and transfer of that training (results) are not attended to. The perception of the nurses focused more on a transfer at the level of personal development rather than on professional growth", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Conclusions NGT is a quick and effective method for obtaining a consensus of ideas or values. In this study, NGT was used to explore the perceptions of a group of nurses on the core competencies acquired in the continuing education process and on how best to transfer them to patient care and, at the same time, to the medical institution. The two groups participating in the study identiﬁed several competencies that are acquired through continuing education and that are transferred to patient care depending on the degree of experience of the participating group. Thus, in the less experienced group, eight key competencies were identiﬁed: holism, care work, organizational barriers, specialization, nontransfer, conﬁdence, knowledge, and instrumental tools", "year": 2023, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "2023_Nurse_Competencies_Healthcare_Performance.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_id": 1707, "text": ". In the more experienced group, there were seven patient-transferable competencies identiﬁed: continuous learning, quality, trust, holism, safe care, autonomy, and technical issues. When asked whether the healthcare system takes advantage of the acquisition of these potential competencies and how it is materialized, group A (newcomers) reﬂected this in four items: professional development, positive learning, negative learning, and recognition. The group with more years of working life reﬂected it in six items: satisfaction, autonomy, creativity, productivity, professional development, and recognition. The conclusions of this study can serve as a guideline for preparation courses and can facilitate the development of evaluation instruments or scales for preceptor training.

Data reliability pertains to the uniformity of data across various records, programs, or platforms, as well as the credibility of the data source. Reliable data remains con - sistently accurate, while unreliable data may not always be valid, making it challenging to ascertain its accuracy. Consequently, organizations cannot depend on unreliable data for decision-making. Data reliability, also referred to as data observability, represents the trustworthiness of data and the insights derived from it for enabling sound decision-making.

Ease of operation, Usability, applicable, utility, Usefulness, Perceived usefulness and importance are common terms that use for describe data relevancy [ 21]. The concept of data usability revolves around a user’s ability to obtain meaningful information from various systems.

Discussion In a few papers, the concept of “fitness for use” was applied to data quality [6, 55, 69]. Two viewpoints can be used to characterize data quality: (1) the inherent quality of the data elements and set, and (2) how the set satis - fies the needs of the user. The definition provided by the International Standards Organization best captures the accepted meaning of data quality, which is “the totality of features and characteristics of an entity that bears on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs” [ 4, 15, 28, 33, 53]", "year": 2024, "topics": ["data-quality", "health-information-systems", "quality"], "category": "health-informatics"}

Current review study identified 14 common dimen - sions for data quality in health information system. In related research data quality dimensions classified on four dimensions include: intrinsic (accuracy, objectiv - ity, reputation), contextual timeliness, completeness, and relevancy), representational (representational format, understandability, consistency), and accessibility (acces - sibility, security) categories [ 53, 60, 69– 71]. There exists a certain level of intersection between the aspects of data quality recognized in this review and those research in prior classifications of data quality. Previous literature has often discussed intrinsic data quality in terms of the absence of defects, as indicated by various dimensions such as accuracy, perfection, fresh - ness, and uniformity [ 72]. and “completeness, unam - biguity, meaningless and correctness” [ 54, 73, 74]", "year": 2024, "topics": ["data-quality", "health-information-systems", "quality"], "category": "health-informatics"}

The Canadian Institute for Health Information put forth a set of 69 quality criteria, organized into 24 quality charac - teristics, and further classified into 6 quality dimensions: accuracy, timeliness, comparability, usability, relevance, and privacy & security [ 58, 71]. Research on data qual - ity has primarily concentrated on recognizing general quality traits like accuracy, currency, completeness, cor - rectness, consistency, and timeliness as fundamental aspects of data quality applicable across different fields. Nevertheless, existing reviews reveal a lack of consen - sus regarding the conceptual framework and definition of data quality [ 70, 73].

However, our pervious review shows there is a lack of consensus conceptual framework and definition for data quality [1, 71]. In this study, the three most-frequently used dimen - sions of data quality were accuracy, completeness and timeliness, respectively. This arrangement is somewhat different from previous literature in which the three most-frequently used dimensions were arranged in the order of completeness, accuracy, and timeliness, respec - tively [43, 51, 53]. Furthermore, the absence of a precise definition of the data quality dimensions led to complexities in evaluating them. The definitions of dimensions and their associated metrics were occasionally based on intuition, past experiences, or the underlying goals. These results indicate that data quality is a multi-faceted phe - nomenon.

Of the total population, 49.7% are female, the median age is 41.0 years, and individuals under 18 years and those over 65 years each comprise about 20% [1]. Swedish citizens comprise 92% of the total population, and 1 in 5 residents were born abroad. The largest foreign-born groups include individuals of Syrian, Iraqi, Finnish, Polish, and Iranian origins (each < 0.5%) [1]. The official main language is Swedish, but English lit - eracy is high across the population [2].

The core values are person-centered, coordinated, proactive, and co-created care. Despite the name, this approach is not bound to primary care. It does not introduce a new level of care but rather strengthens the collaboration between existing caregivers, i.e., across pro - fessional and organizational borders, to provide services that correspond to the growing number of individuals with complex needs. This approach mainly involves primary care centers, specialized outpatient clinics, and municipal homebased patient care", "year": 2025, "topics": ["sweden"], "category": "general"}

The Healthcare Act (SFS 2017:30) mandates that care be provided in proximity to the patient, with a right to medi - cal evaluation within three days [ 56]. Besides timeliness in medical evaluation, more emphasis is placed on continu - ity of care. This model implies strengthened collaboration across the regions and municipalities.

The transition to “Good quality , local healthcare” is facilitated by digital healthcare. As part of the reform, the development of digital infrastructure has allowed some care providers, particularly private ones, to serve people beyond their registered regions. In 2022, there were 6 million digital visits in Sweden. Digital visits made up 1 in 7 primary care visits that year. There was a notable increase in the adop - tion of digital healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic [ 33].

Recent transformations in healthcare Knowledge-driven management within Swedish healthcare For many years, Swedish healthcare has been characterized by national guidelines, quality care registers [ 17], systems for evidence-based medicine (e.g., The Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (Table 1)), and knowledge-sharing between specialists from different regions.

Discussion Healthcare responsibilities in Sweden are shared among the national government, the 21 regional authorities, and the 290 municipalities. The system provides universal access to needed care and is predominantly tax-funded, while the completely private, i.e., voluntary insurance-driven care, is rare.

Prescriptions for COX2 NSAIDs for periods longer than 2 weeks for patients with cardiovascular disorders accounted for 1.33% of prescriptions, and trihexyphenidyl was used as a monotherapy for patients with Parkinson’s disease in 0.18% of cases. From the included medical prescriptions, 32.40% (the major percent of 2383 prescriptions) had two potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). Rural zones were found to be risk factor for PIMs. Decreasing the chronic prescription of NSAIDs and PPIs, discontinuing the use of hypnotic drugs, and avoiding potentially harmful drug–drug associations will have long term beneﬁcial effects for Romanian elderly patients.

Introduction The European Commission’s 2019 report regarding the state of health proﬁles highlighted the fact that Romania is among the countries with the lowest life expectancy in the European Union (EU) (75.3 years in Romania versus 80.9 years in the EU), with large discrepancies between individuals of different genders and education levels [1]. Women live for an average of 7 years longer than men, and the most educated men (with at least a tertiary education level completed) are expected to live 10 years longer than the least educated (who have not completed secondary education) [2]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}
{"doc": "Harnessing_AI_for_Enhanced_Public_Health_Surveillance_A_Narrative_Review.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1992, "text": ". Some of the causes of increased mortality involve behavioral risk factors (smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, low physical activity, and poor nutrition in the form of excessive consumption of salt and sugar and low intake of fruits and vegetables), having a lower number of doctors and nurses per inhabitant, and having much lower health care costs compared with other EU countries (both per patient—1029 versus 2884 EUR/patient in the EU and per percent of gross domestic product (GDP)—5 versus 9.8% in the EU) [1]. It seems that the main causes of death are preventable and treatable pathologies, with diseases of the circulatory system (ischemic heart diseases and stroke) being the primary cause (58.2%), followed by cancer (lung, breast, or colorectal) and respiratory diseases [3]. In light of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, we also have to highlight the susceptibility of elderly people to this virus [4]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}
{"doc": "Harnessing_AI_for_Enhanced_Public_Health_Surveillance_A_Narrative_Review.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1993, "text": ". Elderly people are more likely to develop a severe and critical form of the disease. Diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes can predict poorer outcomes [5], putting elderly people at risk of faster clinical deterioration [6]. In Romania, The National Institute of Public Health provides a weekly report concerning the COVID-19 situation. Their statistics highlight that the median age of death due to COVID-19 is 71 years and that all people who have died from this disease have had at least one comorbidity. It has also been shown that 59.8% of deaths occurred in males [7]. In a case study, the European Commission’s H2020 Expert Group pointed that sex and gender can impact the outcome of contracting COVID-19 and that more men than woman die from acute infection [8]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}
{"doc": "Harnessing_AI_for_Enhanced_Public_Health_Surveillance_A_Narrative_Review.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 1994, "text": ". Regarding the COVID-19 mortality rate in other European countries, data published at the beginning of February 2021 by the WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard showed the following: 3.51% in Hungary, 3.46% in Italy, 2.73% in Germany, 2.54% in Romania, 2.41% in France, and 2.09% in Spain (number of deaths/total number of reported cases) [9]. Primary care services in Romania seem to be less often used than hospital emergency services. Emergency services are often used for less urgent cases, thus increasing the inpatient care costs for the Romanian population [ 1]. Moreover, the vaccination rate is lower than the EU average (8% in Romania versus 44% in the EU among the elderly for inﬂuenza in 2017) [1,10]. Several studies have stated that inappropriate prescription is a major health issue among the elderly in all clinical settings [ 11–13]. The physiological changes that occur during the aging process, result in changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of administered medicines", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Moreover, the presence of comorbidities and polypharmacy, lead to negative outcomes regarding patient safety, such as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These ADRs will later increase the prevalence and incidence of morbidity and mortality in geriatric patients [14]. In order to counteract this problem, clear rules and recommendations for proper utilization of medicines in the elderly population are required. Explicit criteria have been developed in order to improve the selection, efﬁciency, and safety of medication as well as the quality of health care services [15]. The ﬁrst criteria that were developed were the Beers criteria, which were published in 1991 in the USA", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

The STOPP/START criteria are now recognized by several institutes and geriatric societies and are used by many European countries in routine clinical practice [16,17]. In 2016, in a population of elderly community members, Wallace et al. showed that when a minimum of two potentially inappropriate medicines were prescribed, the risk of an ADR was increased (according to the STOPP/START criteria). This, in turn, decreased patients’ quality of life and increased hospitalization rates over a follow-up period of 2 years [ 11].

Moreover, in 2016, Wauters et al. concluded that mortality and hospitalization rates are related to inappropriate medication prescription practices, such as overuse (prescribing more medicines than are clinically needed and with potential harmful effects that exceed the potential beneﬁts) and misuse (incorrectly prescribing a medicine) of medicines [13,18–20]. Romania is currently lacking studies that demonstrate the problems in the healthcare system or in real-life situations (lack of current statistical data). Few studies (three in the last 9 years) have assessed the prescription appropriateness in the elderly population[14,21,22]. Moreover, the county and the city hospitals in Romania lack geriatric doctors, and the European guidelines for appropriate prescription in elderly people have not been implemented (and few specialists know about them) [23]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to assess the prescription habits of general physicians for medications taken as chronic treatments by elderly patients in both urban and rural settings of the western part of Romania and to compare these with the international recommendations for aged people (USA—Beers 2019 criteria and European—STOPP/START v.2, 2015 criteria) [26,27]. This retrospective study, which included a large number of electronic prescriptions for chronic conditions for elderly patients prescribed by Romanian general physicians, showed that more than 85% had medication prescription problems. Below, we discuss some of the most frequent inappropriate prescriptions in light of current recommendations. 4.1. NSAIDs The most commonly encountered problem in our study was the prescription of NSAIDs and therefore the overuse of this class of medicines by Romanian general physicians for the elderly population", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

The Beers 2019 criteria state that the administration of NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and peptic ulcer development, especially if they are used as a chronic treatment for more than 1 year. The use of PPIs or misoprostol reduces, but does not eliminate, this risk. Moreover, the use of NSAIDs can increase blood pressure and induce kidney injury, which can aggravate heart failure, as they promote ﬂuid retention and can increase mortality [ 26]. Therefore, it is recommended to use NSAIDs with caution in the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible period of treatment (acute treatment), as they can induce several gastrointestinal, renal, and/or cardiovascular side effects, as described in Table 7 [40].", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

If these medicines must be used in the elderly, monitoring for common side effects is recommended, especially as several studies have shown that long periods of NSAID exposure increase the risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression, especially if NSAIDs are combined with certain other classes of medicines, such as ACE inhibitors/ARBs and/or diuretics [ 41–43]. We identiﬁed that 2% of cases (56 patients) involved the “triple whammy therapy” (association of RAAS inhibitor + diuretic + NSAID), and 1.15% (32 patients) involved the association of an ACE inhibitor/ARB + NSAID. Several studies have shown that “triple whammy” therapy increases the risk of acute kidney injury, with higher hospitalization rates, especially for men [44,45]. Moreover, the American Geriatric Society noted that NSAID use must be avoided in all patients with end-stage renal failure (CrCl <30 mL/min) [26]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Moreover, the American Geriatric Society noted that NSAID use must be avoided in all patients with end-stage renal failure (CrCl <30 mL/min) [26]. It is important to take the risk of hyponatremia into consideration, as it is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice, especially in the elderly population (due to dehydration, polypharmacy, and comorbidities, which all can induce an electrolyte imbalance) [ 46]. All NSAIDs can induce hyponatremia, even if they are taken for only a few days, as they inhibit the action of the antidiuretic hormone (due to the reduction of renal prostaglandins), causing also water retention. Thus, physicians must consider this risk, as well as the associations of medicines that can aggravate hyponatremia, as even mild forms of hyponatremia are associated with negative clinical outcomes, such as cognitive impairment, falls, hospitalizations, and mortality [ 46]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Moreover, a higher mortality rate has been observed in patients with moderate or severe hyponatremia [47,48]. In addition, the STOPP/START v.2 criteria state that the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (the most commonly prescribed medicines nowadays) must be avoided in patients with hyponatremia, as they can exacerbate this condition, while the 2019 Beers criteria also include tramadol in the list of medicines that can aggravate hyponatremia or cause inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) [26,27,48]. Thus, it is extremely important to decrease the number of chronic prescriptions of NSAIDs in the Romanian elderly population and to monitor sodium levels in patients undergoing chronic treatment with NSAIDs, as deleterious effects can arise, with extremely dangerous consequences", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

In addition to prescriptions, our research group showed (in another study performed) that more than 65% of the Romanian population use NSAIDs for self-medication, especially patients with cardiovascular pathologies, despite the European Medicine Agency recommendations (on safety precautions of particular NSAIDs) and probably because diclofenac formulations are the cheapest medicines on the market [49]. Thus, members of the Romanian population are large consumers of NSAIDs, although Romania is among the EU countries with the highest incidence of acute coronary syndrome [1].

Moreover, as renal function is affected by senescence, practitioners should avoid prescribing medicines that can increase this risk (for the elderly) when taken in association, as the renal blood ﬂow, number of functional nephrons, and renal ﬁltration rate are already affected by the aging process. Certain prescription associations also increase the risk of community-acquired hyperkalemia in the elderly [44,45].

It is well known that this kind of association highly increases the hemorrhagic risk. Based on the fact that a very small proportion of the Romanian population has targeted INR (International Normalized Ratio) values under anticoagulant treatment, it is advisable to avoid this association for members of the Romanian elderly population [51]. 4.2.

The 2019 Beers criteria mention the risks of bone loss, fracture, and C. difﬁcile infection with long-term PPI treatment. Moreover, several publications have shown that long-term use (>2 months) of PPIs is associated with the following side effects, which are particularly harmful in elderly patients: vitamin B 12 and iron deﬁciency, hypomagnesaemia, bone demineralization and fragility, intestinal and other infections (bacterial overgrowth, non-typhoidal Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridium difﬁcile, community-acquired pneumonia), impaired cognition and affect, and increased risk of chronic kidney disease [52–54]. PPI use was recently associated with the onset of dementia and depression in the elderly population, although the exact mechanism by which this occurs is not clear (it might be due to vitamin B12 malabsorption)", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the risks and beneﬁts when prescribing PPIs for the elderly for long periods of time and to consider potential drug–drug interactions in patients with polypharmacy, as PPIs are inhibitors of the P450 cytochrome [55,56]. 4.3. Theophylline We also identiﬁed the prescription of theophylline as a monotherapy by Romanian general physicians for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Theophylline is a narrow therapeutic window bronchodilator. The 2019 Beers criteria and the STOPP/START v2 2015 criteria recommend the use of beta 2 adrenomimetic or anticholinergic bronchodilators, which are more effective and less toxic compared with theophylline, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [26,27,57]. Therapy with theophylline requires monitoring of its concentration in the serum, and patients can experience toxicity symptoms like arrhythmia or convulsions before nausea and vomiting occur (Table 8)", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Moreover, smokers require higher doses of the medication, and smoking cessation increases its toxicity. It is susceptible to drug–drug interactions with the following medicines: phenytoin, ciproﬂoxacin, co-trimoxazole, levothyroxine, and benzodiazepines [58]. In addition, as cardiovascular diseases are the primary pathologies encountered in the elderly Romanian population (based on our study ﬁndings using the percentages of chronic conditions and other European reports) [ 59], treatment with theophylline can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications with serious side effects, especially in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation and congestive heart failure. Thus, due to the low risk/beneﬁt ratio and despite its low price, it is recommended that theophylline is replaced with other bronchodilator medicines (β2-agonists or anticholinergics) with safer and more efﬁcient proﬁles", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Moreover, they induce minimal improvements in sleep latency and duration [26]. Romanian legislation (Law 39/2005) demands that benzodiazepine and zolpidem drugs are prescribed on secure prescription forms and not with the basic electronic formulary; this is why our study did not include these substances [ 32]. Only zopiclone can be prescribed with the classical electronic prescription form, and as expected, our study shows that it is overprescribed in the elderly population. It is worth mentioning that older people are the most vulnerable and susceptible to developing side effects of sleep medication, Z drugs, and benzodiazepines, so it is recommended to use them at the lowest effective dose (half the adult dose) and for a short period of time (4 weeks) [61,62]. Moreover, the 2019 Beers criteria mention that they have minimal efﬁcacy in treating insomnia, with a high probability of developing adverse reactions [26]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

The current recommendations regarding insomnia treatment focus on cognitive behavioral therapy, as maintaining cognitive functioning is an important aspect that must be taken into account in the elderly [61]. Moreover, sleep-disordered breathing should be diagnosed in a timely manner and treated effectively in elderly patients, as it can be a prime cause of sleep disorders [61,62]. An alternative medicine for the treatment of sleep disorders could be melatonin (as its natural secretion decreases with age), which is better tolerated and has fewer side effects. Moreover, it was recently reported to have renal protective properties, which could be beneﬁcial for elderly patients [50]. 4.5.

It is recommended that COX2 NSAIDs to be avoided as chronic treatments for patients with cardiovascular pathologies due to the high incidence of acute coronary complications (e.g., myocardial infarction) [27]. Moreover, the 2019 Beers recommendations state that COX2 NSAIDs and thiazolidinediones should be used with caution in patients with asymptomatic heart failure and avoided in those with symptomatic heart failure [26].

Another study performed in Brazil in very old hospitalized patients emphasized (after applying the 2019 Beers criteria) that polypharmacy occurs in approximately 84.6% of cases and that the most commonly encountered PIMs are metoclopramide, omeprazole, regular insulin, and haloperidol [65]. A study performed on South Korean geriatrics and published in 2018 showed that chlorpheniramine and amitriptyline were the most frequently prescribed PIMs (after applying the Beers Criteria) [66]. Other studies on the Romanian elderly population have shown that aged people living in villages have a signiﬁcantly higher rate of prolonged hospitalization due to the lack of nearby hospitals [67] and the lack of specialists in small cities and rural areas [ 68].In addition to this data, in the present study, we found rural zones to be a risk factor for the incidence of PIM which could contribute to the risk of ADR and also to hospitalization rates, as other studies reported [ 11]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Moreover, a study performed by Simionescu et al. highlighted the fact that in order to reduce the mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases, the amount of health care spending per person must be increased by the government [68]. Another study that evaluated patients’ adherence to antihypertensive therapy in urban family medical practices concluded that Romania needs further strategies and management strategy methods to increase patients’ adherence to treatment [69]. 4.8. Purpose of Solutions Regarding health expenditure in Romania compared to other European countries, it can easily be observed that some of the budget allocated to the health sector could be invested more strategically, with higher efﬁciency, especially for the prevention of diseases that generate high treatment costs (if they are not discovered in time). From the point of view of investing public budgets in health care, there are notable differences between Romania and other EU countries [70]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

From the point of view of investing public budgets in health care, there are notable differences between Romania and other EU countries [70]. In the last ﬁve years, according to statistics provided by Eurostat and the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), Romania has allocated about 5% of its gross domestic product to health spending [70,71]. When compared to Switzerland, which invests about 12.5% of its GDP in health, or the European average, which is close to 7% of the GDP , it is clear that there is a major difference between Romania and other civilized countries in this regard. Additionally, of interest for our research is that, according to Eurostat statistics, regarding the destination of invested health budgets, in Romania, approximately 54.4% is spent on treating and rehabilitating patients, 27% is spent on equipment and goods needed in the medical process, and only 18% is spent on other expenses, including prevention", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

(The percentage allocated to preventive medicine from the state budget is about 1.8%, far below the European average.) Another distinctive aspect noted in the OECD statistics is the way in which health budgets are formed at the level of the European Union and the distinct characteristics of Romania. Whereas in states with a high-performing health system, the share of government schemes and private ﬁnancial instruments prevails, in Romania, the citizens’ contributions are the main source of funding for the health system. Almost 70% of Romanian health system costs come from citizen contributions, compared to Switzerland, where citizens contribute 40% and the state identiﬁes other ways, including private ones, to ensure the stability of the national health budget [70,71]", "year": null, "topics": ["public-health", "public-health-surveillance"], "category": "policy"}

Moreover, the use of technology, digital innovation, and digitalization as part of the national strategy can contribute signiﬁcantly to making public health spending more efﬁcient [72]. The use of electronic patient medical records is an immediate action that should be implemented in the Romanian health care system. From an economic point of view, the emergence of the eHealthcare ﬁeld could greatly optimize the spending of budgets and ensure better prevention [73–75]. Teamwork between specialists (doctors, pharmacists, nurses) is also mandatory for a patient-centered approach with a lower incidence of iatrogenic events [76]. 4.9.

Moreover, we emphasize the urgent need to improve and correctly implement prevention strategies and effective treatment programs and to reinforce the proﬁciency/suitability of primary care, especially for elderly Romanians (who take the largest number of medicines), as the population is aging [77,78]. 4.10.

Conclusions Several prescription problems have been identiﬁed in the Romanian primary care setting for patients with chronic pathologies. NSAIDs, PPIs, H2 antagonists, theophylline, and zopiclone were found to be among the medicines prescribed more often than clinically needed and that have potential harmful effects that exceed potential beneﬁts. Additionally, duplication of pharmacological classes was observed. The association of RAAS inhibitors in patients with renal failure in addition to the utilization of COX2 NSAIDs were among the most commonly observed problems involving incorrect prescription. Thus, decreasing the chronic prescription of NSAIDs and PPIs, discontinuing the use of hypnotic drugs, and avoiding potentially harmful drug–drug associations will have long term beneﬁcial effects for Romanian elderly patients.

Many environmental factors, including high patient volumes, overburdened staff, long waits, and a tense atmosphere, conv erge in the ED. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of extant literature to understand how the ED environment drives patient experience and identify methodological or empirical insights for patient-centered ED design.

We used 33 articles for a co-citation analysis, revealing three interdisciplinary clusters and promising potential for collaboration across fields. Thirty articles were subjected to a full-text analysis, resulting in the identification of three overarching dimensions linking the ED environment to patient experience. Conclusion: The most commonly identified factors influencing patient experience in the ED included overcrowding and wait times, privacy, and communication; however, existing literature is limited", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}

Keywords evidence-based design (EBD), emergency department, environmental design, environment of care, patient experience, emergency medicine, patient satisfaction, healthcare environment, health facility design Introduction Clinical settings, in general, and emergency departments (EDs), in particular, have long been described as complex, overwhelming, and stressful environments (Aaronson et al., 2018; Boyle et al., 2012; Gordon et al., 2010; Sonis et al., 2019; Ulrich, 1991). EDs are further characterized by high patient volumes, rising service demands, overburdened staff, and an atmosphere of continual exigency (Brysiewicz & Emmamally, 2017; Cypress, 2014; Oyegbile & Brysiewicz, 2020)", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}
{"doc": "Healthcare_Environment_and_Patient_Experience_in_Service_Delivery.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2089, "text": ". While diverse structural and process elements constitute this environment, the ED is typically designed to prioritize its main function, that is, to save lives and minimize morbidity (Bailey et al., 2011). This is reflected, for example, in the ED’s open floor layouts, mobile treatment trolleys placed in close proximity to each other and to staff, and curtained cubicles instead of solid partitions (Weiland et al., 2017). In addition, ED operations are also reliant upon many intangible elements that enable smooth service delivery, such as complex communication protocols and triage systems. These and other design attributes facilitate continual patient monitoring, easy access to medical equipment, and rapid response to emergent and urgent situations. However, it is also the same attributes—which facilitate timely and efficient response in a high-tension setting— that may negatively affect patient experiences of seeking and receiving care", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}
{"doc": "Healthcare_Environment_and_Patient_Experience_in_Service_Delivery.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2090, "text": ". Within healthcare quality literature, it is wellestablished that EDs continue to be undersized, understaffed, and rife with outdated operational procedures, resulting in bottlenecks and redundant processes that contribute to long wait times and other stress factors (McKay, 1999; Sonis et al., 2019). With competing functional requirements, optimal care provision a nd patient satisfaction are at risk of being compromised (Weiland et al., 2015). At the same time, for an increasing number of people, the ED forms the initial point of contact with the health system, often constituting a patient’s first hospital experience. The ED has thus aptly been called the “front door of the hospital—as important as the lobby and other high-end areas in creating an overall impression of an institution, its attitude towards its patients, and the quality of care offered” (Glasser, 1998, p. 1)", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}

Therefore, we contend that the role of design and designers in the ED environment concerns many explicit and implicit drivers of functionality, usability, and the overall care experience with and within the built space. Our review is intended to provide an improved understanding of the ED as a designed environment where patientcentered care may be cu ltivated and enhanced through better design choices. Before proceeding onto our methodology and findings, we provide below a brief background of commonly used terms and their implications in this context, given the interdisciplinarity of the subject matter. Defining Terminology—Health Facility Design and Evidence-Based Design Health facility design (HFD) is a generalized phrase used to describe a wide spectrum of activities relating to planning, constructing, and optimizing healthcare settings", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}

However, as health systems face demographic shifts, technological change, and increased disease burden, healthcare facilities— many of which were designed decades ago—must evolve correspondingly to meet arising challenges, competing demands, and new ways of working (McKay, 1999). To keep pace with rapid clinical advancements and transforming healthcare needs, medical practice has shifted toward evidence-based medicine—where there is an emphasis on utilizing the best available current research to inform treatment decisions (Sackett et al., 1996)", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}

Drawing upon this core ideal and borrowing from its terminology, HFD has similarly experienced a move toward evidence-based design (EBD) , with the goal of improving healthcare quality and patient outcomes through research-informed choices in design practice (Halawa et al., 2020). EBD can hence be broadly described as a framework that encourages the use of rigorous scientific methods to identify and respond appropriately to the links between built environments and human health (Ulrich et al., 2008). Over the past decade, EBD has been incorporated at various levels in building, planning, managing, and improving many healthcare settings (Zimring et al., 2013), with a growing number of disciplines and professions now engaged within and across these domains. Given its varying applications and the diversity of expertise contributing to the field, the terms EBD and HFD are often used in parallel, and even interchangeably, in the literature base", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}

Rather, the remainder of this paper intends EBD and HFD to mean the one and the same thing in order to capture the breadth of the field, despite variations in voc abulary. As such, we employ these terms in a broad sense, primarily, to position the ED as a designed healthcare environment, and secondarily, to frame design activity widely, including but not limited to physical considerations within.

Evidence-Based Health Facility Design— From Micro to Macro Level While EBD is most commonly seen as the incorporation of scientific methods in live and ongoing HFD or quality improvement projects, concerns have been raised that “the demonstrated value of such methods, however, has not yet resulted in their widespread adoption in healthcare design process in practice” (Halawa et al., 2020, p. 454). We theorize that this problem stems, at least in part, from the relative novelty of design as an academic discipline, where research, theory, and education have frequently lagged behind developments in the field (Rowe et al., 2020).

In many scientific investigations or industrial projects to im prove health facilities, some of these stages may overlap, contain cyclical iterations, or only involve a few components, rather than all. Moreover, most interventions to improve ED experiences focus on isolated features of the environment at the micro scale, with emerging evidence proving difficult to generalize easily. While we are interested in design activity at any stage or scale, we do not aim to appraise the role of each element of the built environment individually. Instead, in our study, we adopt a highlevel, complex systems perspective to source and analyze evidence that links ED design to its impact on patient experience.

Recent literature has suggested a strong correlation between positive assessments of patient experience and important health system goals, including improved health outcomes and care quality, higher staff satisfaction, and reduced medicolegal risk (Sonis et al., 2019). Patient experience is “the sum of all interactions, shaped by an organization’s culture, that influence patient perceptions, across the continuum of care” (The Beryl Institute, 2016), thus indicating a corresponding need for patientcentered health settings and services. However, patient experience in the ED differs from that in other healthcare settings (Aaronson et al., 2018).

Unexpectedly, however, Sayah et al.

They concluded that reorganizing process flow and providing rapid assessment services was more effective for improving patient experience than facility expansions and renovations.

For example, in Vezyridis and Timmons’s (2014) study, ED wait-time targets were found to alter provider roles and responsibilities, restructure professional hierarchies, and generate resultant pressures on ED staff—with potentially negative implications for patient and staff interactions. Other studies, both from our review sample and those in the broader literature base, have shown that the experience of waiting, in and of itself, is subject to multiple influences. As Sayah et al.

We comment upon these in a subsequent section of this article (see Cerebral and Embodied Experience subsection). Recognizing the interaction of multiple factors driving ED experience (Zamani, 2019), several authors recommended the use of lean tools to manage high patient volumes and improve overall efficiency. Lean concepts first gained prominence through the work of the Toyota Production Service in the 1950s and have since seen numerous business and service sector applications, with increasing uptake across healthcare management over the decades.

Although used extensively in healthcare quality improvement, concerns have been raised that lean thinking techniques are often applied singularly, rather than being combined together for better outcomes (Robinson et al., 2012).

Additionally, patient satisfaction is found to increase when patients’ needs for information about their health status are met and their involvement in medical decision-making is considered—a goal often achieved through the use of digital aids and empathetic staff communication.

Further research is needed to understand how healthcare user perspectives can be incorporated meaningfully in the design of patient-centered EDs.

Acknowledging that staff satisfaction may implicitly influence patient satisf action and experiences with care services, we highlight three subdomains from these studies that merit further investigation. The usability of the ED environment for staff affects their ability to provide appropriate, compassionate, efficient, and timely care to patients (Fay et al., 2018; Gharaveis et al., 2018; Meng et al., 2021; Zamani, 2019), suggesting a critical need to develop and validate models for staff engagement in ED design and improvement. Next, ED staff are particularly prone to burnout as a result of long hours spent working in a tense 324 Health Environments Research & Design Journal 16(2)", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}

Finally, pertaining to both security concerns as well as staff emotional health, future research should explore how design can help safeguard against rising violence towards ED staff (Lenaghan et al., 2018). In general, we found that research concerning ED design is often limited in scope to a single location, or targets individual design attributes within EDs, despite the widely recognized need for synergistic improvement methods more suited to the ED’s co-attendant structures and processes. In addition, local variations across EDs mean that quality improvement priorities—and strategies for addressing them—may differ greatly", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}

In addition, local variations across EDs mean that quality improvement priorities—and strategies for addressing them—may differ greatly. In this regard, the literature offers promising evidence on the use of interdisciplinary techniques and stakeholder participation for attaining patientcentered outcomes in ED improvement. The need for diverse stakeholder perspectives (from both patients and staff) is especially pertinent for informing ED design; yet, the literature indicates limited representation in participatory knowledge generation from these groups. For this reason, we urge researchers to employ (and to report on their successes and failures with employing) participatory design approaches that harness these largely untapped knowledge sources when devising and conducting future ED quality improvement research", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-experience"], "category": "service-design"}

Consequently, researchers at the University of Gothenburg Centre for PersonCentred Care are currently delivering person-centred interventions employing a framework that incorporates three routines. These include eliciting the patient’s narrative, agreeing a partnership with shared goals between patient and professional, and safeguarding this through documentation.

Recent debates about patient-centredness and person-centredness demonstrate a shift towards inclusivity and equity in the professional – patient relationship (4). In keeping with other healthcare providers internationally, Swedish healthcare professionals seek to strengthen the position of patients and their participation in care (5).

Evidence suggests that PCC can be delivered effectively (8), and patients with long-term conditions beneﬁt from this approach (9 –11). Moreover, researchers report that PCC can be facilitated through effective leadership (12, 13) and by knowledgeable professionals with sound communication skills (7). The uptake of PCC remains sporadic as barriers are identiﬁed as well as facilitators (14 –18). As McCormack (19) suggests the context of the care environment has the greatest potential to restrict or support PCC in practice. The implementation of PCC can also vary depending upon patient populations, providers of care and settings and how professionals and patients understand what constitutes caring (20). Additional challenges to PCC include professional practice, beliefs and cultures (21); professionals erroneously believing that they are practicing PCC; or reverting to disease-centred care when under pressure (15)", "year": null, "topics": ["person-centered-care"], "category": "service-design"}

How PCC is translated into practice remains challenging (22) and person-centredness needs to be considered in the wider context in terms of the care environment and beyond (17). The implementation of PCC poses challenges. Few studies describe how healthcare professionals can become proﬁcient, well-trained PCC practitioners and integrate theory into practice in contrasting settings (23). Less is known about what we can learn from implementing and evaluating PCC in the context of routine care, patients’ priorities and personal needs. Addressing these gaps is important to gain insight into the factors that help or hinder understanding, acceptance and implementation. To improve the practice of PCC, researchers at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, successfully obtained national funding to establish the Centre for PersonCentred Care (GPCC)", "year": null, "topics": ["person-centered-care"], "category": "service-design"}

At GPCC, about 40 research projects are currently investigating PCC from the perspective of people with long-term conditions and health professionals delivering care (24). These studies are based in various hospital, primary care and community settings in Sweden. At GPCC, the term person-centred care (PCC), as opposed to patient-centred care is preferred, as this acknowledges the person behind the patient (12). This centre funds and conducts research in the ﬁeld of PCC, in a variety of healthcare settings, anchored within a model of PCC that has clear philosophical and practical guidance. The GPCC model of PCC relies upon three simple routines (15, 25). The ﬁrst routine elicits the patient narrative or subjective account of the person’s illness experience, strengths and future plans. The second agrees a partnership with shared decisions and goals between professional, patient and often their relatives, and the third routine ensures this partnership and narrative is documented.

Several researchers reported working within a positivist healthcare tradition, described by one interviewee as the ‘heavy machinery of their healthcare service’ it’s built up around the biomedical paradigm.

Professionals working according to traditional care pathways restrict the freedom to do things differently than ‘usual care’. The ability to work ﬂexibly and use different strategies was described by some researchers as a prerequisite for PCC. Existing power relationships, invariably built around physicians, were perceived as troublesome to change. The surgical setting proved a particularly tough climate for PCC with ‘a high patient turnover’ and standardised prescribing (R8). Researchers described situations where patients were programmed to speak and act in a particular way that restricted the freedom to engage in a person-centred dialogue: Some patients you want them to speak freely and to take up things that they feel are of importance, but 664 L.

Biomedical knowledge and technological aspects of care, although a necessity for some professionals, posed challenges for the PCC approach. In some cases, professionals prioritised ‘objective data’ and screens in cardiology (R12) or medications in involuntary care to control psychotic symptoms, rather than immediately listen to the patient’s narrative. a person arrives to the clinic with police transport and is placed in involuntary care, the ﬁrst thing to do is try to get a grip of the symptoms, and it’s not until that is underway that it’s actually going to be possible to have this interview with the patient to create the care plan (R14) For this researcher, only once the Medication is administered are they able to talk, ‘share worlds’ and elicit the narrative", "year": null, "topics": ["person-centered-care"], "category": "service-design"}

I will reduce weight by 50%, I will do this and in 2 months I will do ... ’ And then you can say that ‘Well, what you want to do sounds ﬁne but it’s not possible’.

But we have a different role and we need to work together with the physician, not under the physician. Which is what usually happens (R8). Two researchers also identiﬁed physical structures that proved an obstacle to elucidating a narrative and developing a partnership.

It took time to participate in training, education and develop partnerships for professionals and patients. Similarly, professionals needed to learn new communication techniques for patients with communication disorders or work with older migrants, through translators. The fast pace of healthcare activities, in some contexts, made PCC implementation difﬁcult.

Several researchers described working with professionals who said they were practicing PCC when they were not. Maintaining a PCC approach required conscious effort. The routine of partnership was affected when professionals ‘do not see the person’ and argue with a patient with psychosis, rather than calmly listening to the narrative. Another researcher described professionals viewing patients with IBS as ‘malingerers’ who engendered mistrust (R6). Personal politics towards both co-workers and patients affected PCC delivery: there’s an attitude lacking.

Researchers described barriers related to the intervention design, population, care setting and existing documentation systems. Facilitators Despite the barriers outlined above, researchers also identiﬁed where organisational factors, leadership and training, the attitude and approach of professionals and how PCC was delivered across projects helped rather than hindered the delivery of PCC (See Table 3).

The majority of researchers described leadership styles that instigated organisational change, emphasising PCC values and working practice, and interprofessional team working. Leaders served as role models and forerunners, consistently working in a PCC way. For one researcher, personal politics played a part: How you view your, er, co-workers, I believe in a person-centred leadership as well, that every coworker needs to be regarded as a person and be seen as who they are and what they want to do (R16) Multidisciplinary teamwork meant collaborating with patients, health professionals and experts, across organisations.

Professional attitudes and approach Researchers cited the importance of interested staff and a committed group of professionals with a positive attitude that allowed for trust and partnership building.

Our study shows how professionals from diverse clinical backgrounds collaborate with professionals and patients to employ person-centred research.

This includes the analysis of 18 additional interviews with professionals who are more established with the implementation of PCC and interviews with 20 patients who have experienced the GPCC model of PCC Conclusion PCC has the potential to transform patient care and clinical practice. However, for the PCC approach to be successful, there needs to be a power shift and a mindset change to allow the space, time and opportunity to focus on the narrative and partnership. Explicit and consistent leadership is facilitative. However, documenting the narrative remains problematic when faced with established systems. Although this study presents a particular PCC model facilitated and implemented at GPCC, the ﬁndings provide useful guidance for developing PCC interventions across different healthcare settings", "year": null, "topics": ["person-centered-care"], "category": "service-design"}

Interventions need to be adapted to ﬁt the needs of both patients and professionals. PCC leadership and training can help address generic barriers and facilitate changes to traditional practices, systems and attitudes. Professionals, who are trained and committed to the GPCC model, can motivate others to implement PCC in other healthcare settings, therefore maintaining the continuity and quality of the implementation. This research demonstrates that developing PCC interventions and integrating these into practice takes time and professionals need on-going support to establish and maintain PCC.

Results: The provisional AI implementation framework, called SALIENT, was mapped to 5 stages common to both the taxonomy and the reporting standards. A scoping review retrieved 20 studies and 247 themes, stages, and subelements were identiﬁed. A gap analysis identiﬁed 5 new cross-stage themes and 16 new tasks. The ﬁnal framework comprised 5 stages, 7 elements, and 4 components, including the AI system, data pipeline, human-computer interface, and clinical workﬂow. Discussion: This pragmatic framework resolves gaps in existing stage- and theme-based clinical AI implementation guidance by comprehensively addressing the what (components), when (stages), and how (tasks) of AI implementation, as well as the who (organization) and why (policy domains). By integrating research reporting standards into SALIENT, the framework is grounded in rigorous evaluation methodologies.

Background We define implementation by extending the Cambridge dictionary definition 23 as the act of starting to use a plan or system to change or incorporate a new intervention into clinical practice. We define AI as computer programs that learn from and can make predictions based on data, including machine learning/deep learning models.

Nilsen defines a framework as, “a structure, overview, outline, system or plan consisting of various descriptive categories... and the relations between them that are presumed to account for a phenomenon.” 29 An example of a parallel operational clinical implementation framework is the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Drug Development Process. 18 Such a framework is needed in identifying clear steps and transparent evaluation gateways that provide a systematic pathway for organizations to minimize the risks associated with incorporating new drugs into clinical practice. There is currently no equivalent widely acknowledged framework for implementing AI interventions into clinical practice, yet the systematic methodology to evaluate clinical AI implementation at multiple stages exists, as reported in Vasey et al’s Decide-AI reporting standard ( Figure 1 )", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Prior clinical implementation frameworks generally fit into 2 of Nilsen’s 5 framework categories: Determinant and process models. 29 Determinant frameworks identify themes or domains that can influence implementation outcomes, such as Greenhalgh et al’s nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Process models, which usually specify stages in the process of translating research into practice, 29 redress some of these deficiencies. In the case of Sendak et al, 32 a pathway consisting of 3 primary stages is proposed based on their experience: (1) design and develop; (2) evaluate and validate; (3) diffuse and scale. Van De Sande et al also proposed a step-by-step approach with 5 phases and 16 steps based on synthesis of data from a literature review. 33 The phases are quite different to those of Sendak et al and others, 34 and none are aligned with the AI reporting standards.

However, for the introduction of AI, as with the process for implementing other clinical interventions such as new drugs, staged evaluation of the intervention is central; yet none of the frameworks mentioned above are founded on this common approach. We hypothesized that by deriving a staged AI implementation framework directly aligned with the AI reporting standards and grounded in a well-established theory of translating clinical informatics interventions into practice, a more systematic staged approach would emerge. Because the AI reporting standards are limited by their focus on evaluation, we also sought to augment the derived framework with elements from prior AI frameworks", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS Derivation of a provisional clinical AI implementation framework The AI reporting standards and associated item lists provide a foundation for a framework but lack process and structure. We therefore reviewed prior theoretical frameworks (AHV, IAS) for possible candidates that could align with the standards, identifying these through scrutinizing articles found within 3 review papers and further snowballing", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

During candidate appraisal, determinant models were excluded because they did not support stages and would be radically modified by their addition. 25–28,38–41 Process models did have stages, 33,42 but they were fixed and varied in number and content from the AI reporting standards stages.

Stead et al identified 5 key elements in developing and implementing interventions: (A) Specification; (B) Component development; (C) Combination of components into a system; (D) Integration of system into environment; and (E) Routine use. We chose this as our baseline framework because of its clinical orientation, end-to-end nature, flexibility to incorporate solution components and close stage-alignment with the AI reporting standards", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "Healthcare_Technology_Implementation_Framework.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_id": 2273, "text": ". While the stages of the Stead taxonomy are designed for any clinical informatics intervention, we intuited that analyzing the items in the current AI reporting standards may identify specific components and tasks that could be aligned with each stage for AI-based interventions. Accordingly, we used the following method to derive the provisional framework (see Supplementary Appendix SA for more details and examples): Step 1: Define the baseline implementation stages: Map each implementation stage, as reported in the DECIDE-AI guideline, 21 to the similar stage in the Stead taxonomy (see Table 1). Step 2: Identify the intervention components and their associated implementation tasks: For each reporting item specified in TRIPOD, DECIDE-AI, and CONSORT-AI 19,21,22,43 identify existing or create new components and component tasks and assign the implementation stage based on the mapping identified in Step 1, as exemplified in Table 2", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

This step was initially performed by AV and then using his draft task list, RS repeated the task creation independently. The final harmonized task set was agreed by consensus (RS, AV). Step 3: Consolidate similar components and component tasks identified in Step 2 into a final reduced task and component set. Step 4: Back- or forward-fill missing tasks across stages as, in some instances, tasks are identified in one stage and required in earlier or later stages but the latter stage reporting standards make no provision for them. For example, CONSORT-AI item 4b (Extension) is, “Describe how the AI intervention was integrated into the trial setting, including any onsite or offsite requirements.” 22 A stage V task generated from this item is the data pipeline component task, “Develop real-time data capture/transform capability.” However, this task is required in both the silent study stage (III) and the small pilot trial stage (IV), where real-time data are Table 1", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Missing or partially mapped elements were grouped and assigned to one of: (1) new stage; (2) new cross-stage element, where the missing element was applicable across more than one stage; (3) new component; or (4) new component task. The purpose of this step was to augment SALIENT with prior framework themes and stages that it was missing, generating a more comprehensive and useful final AI implementation framework. RESULTS Derivation of provisional implementation framework The outputs of the 5-step process were used to derive our provisional implementation framework, titled the staged clinical AI implementation (SALIENT) framework ( Figure 1 ). This comprised 5 implementation stages, labeled I to V, positioned across the top of Figure 1 and 5 elements, labeled A to E, positioned down the left-hand side. Element A, specification, describes preparatory work to clearly articulate the problem definition and proposed intervention (hereafter termed solution) specification", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "Healthcare_Technology_Implementation_Framework.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_id": 2280, "text": ". Element B comprises the development of 4 essential solution components: (1) AI model; (2) data pipeline; (3) human-computer interface (HCI); and (4) clinical workflow. Component development is divided into 3 engineering steps: (1) design; (2) develop and test; and (3) update. The stage-timing of these steps depends on the solution requirements at each stage for each component. For example, at the retrospective stage (II), the AI model is designed, developed, and validated using static datasets, whereas development and testing of the data pipeline using live or near-live data is only required at the silent study stage (III). Element C of SALIENT combines solution components into functioning systems over 3 stages. Firstly, the technical system (TSv1) comprising the AI model and data pipeline are integrated for the silent study stage (III). In Stage IV, the HCI must also be integrated (TSv2) so that evaluation of cliniciancomputer interactions can be performed", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

In Stage IV, the HCI must also be integrated (TSv2) so that evaluation of cliniciancomputer interactions can be performed. Following further iterations and refinement of the system in response to these study results, the final technical system is completed for the large trial or roll-out in Stage V. Element D of SALIENT marks the coming together of the overall solution when the system is integrated into the live, routine clinical practice environment. The clinical solution (CSv1) must be ready at stage IV, comprising the technical solution (TSv2) and the clinical workflows, which is then updated ready for final trial and rollout in stage V. Element E, routine use, denotes all tasks required for normal continuous operation of the solution. Table 2.

Strengths and limitations As far as we know, SALIENT is the only clinical AI implementation framework that conceptualizes all important tasks and solution components as one integrated schema ( Figure 3).

SALIENT allows both clinicians and technologists to drill down, with a high level of structured detail missing in other guidance reports, 30 to task-level responsibilities for each stage of implementation and for each component of the overall AI solution.

Results: Eighty- one articles were included. An acceleration of patient journey map - ping research was observed, with 76.5% ( n = 62) of articles published since 2015. Diverse mapping approaches were identified. Reporting of studies was inconsistent and largely non- adherent with relevant, established reporting guidelines. Conclusion: Patient journey mapping is a relatively novel approach for understanding patient experiences and is increasingly being adopted. There is variation in process details reported. Considerations for improving reporting standards are provided. Impact: Patient journey mapping is a rapidly growing approach for better understand - ing how people enter, experience and exit health services.

Clinicians and researchers have adapted a research approach from the marketing industry to gain insight into how individuals navigate and experience these health systems (Crosier & Handford, 2012). This approach has become known as ‘patient journey mapping’ (Davies et al., 2022 ). Patient journey mapping is an increasingly popular approach to evaluating the experiences of individuals as they navigate complex and dynamic health services and systems (Sijm- Eeken et al., 2020). Projects where patient journey mapping methods are used almost always place individuals at the centre of the research in attempts to both understand and improve the experience of the individual and the systems that they navigate (Kelly et al., 2016, 2017; Kushniruk et al., 2020)", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}
{"doc": "Patient_Journey_Mapping_and_Healthcare_Service_Design.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2347, "text": ". One specific advantage is the capacity of this type of research to provide nuanced clarity about peoples' experiences as they traverse health systems rather than only capturing single episodes of care. In this scoping review, the nature of these proj - ects is considered, with a particular focus on how patient journey mapping research is being reported in published literature (Davies et al., 2022). 1.1  |  Background The terminology used to describe patient journey mapping projects varies, and includes; process mapping (Barton et al., 2019; Frew et al., 2020; Trebble et al., 2010), patient journey modelling (Curry et al., 2007), journey mapping (Bearnot & Mitton, 2020), and client journey mapping (Dawson et al., 2017; Schildmeijer et al., 2019). Several definitions for patient journey mapping approaches to re - search have been provided in the literature. Barton et al.

{"doc": "Patient_Journey_Mapping_and_Healthcare_Service_Design.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2348, "text": ". Several definitions for patient journey mapping approaches to re - search have been provided in the literature. Barton et al. (2019, p. 1) describe it as “a map of the steps a client takes as he or she progress (sic) through different stages of a disease, often capturing diagnosis and management and interactions with health professionals”. Curry et al. (2007, p. 905) define this process as “a patient- centric activ - ity that details a patient's progress through a healthcare system for a given service”. In this review, patient journey mapping is viewed as a patient- oriented project that has been undertaken to better understand barriers, facilitators, experiences, interactions with ser - vices and/or outcomes for individuals and/or their carers and family members as they enter, navigate, experience and exit one or more services in a health system by documenting elements of the journey to produce a visual or descriptive map", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}
{"doc": "Patient_Journey_Mapping_and_Healthcare_Service_Design.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2349, "text": ". The reasons for undertaking patient journey mapping vary and have included improving the quality of care provided through under - standing patient experiences with greater detail; better understand - ing the relationship that develops dynamically between patients and service organizations, and exploring the lived experiences of people from stigmatized or disadvantaged populations who may have addi - tional challenges or barriers to accessing and remaining in contact with health services (Bearnot & Mitton, 2020; Lawrence et al., 2021; McCarthy et al., 2020 ; Richardson et al., 2007 ). Patient journey mapping projects have been undertaken using a variety of data collection and analytical approaches that have in - cluded physically tracking patients' movements through health ser - vices (Barton et al., 2019 ), interviewing or surveying patients, family members and healthcare workers about experiences of navigating a health system or health services (Barton et al., 2019, p", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}

Not only is there variability in how researchers and clinicians ap - proach patient journey mapping projects, but there is also variety in what is reported in publications. As recently noted by Sijm- Eeken et al., there is no standardized approach for how to perform patient journey mapping, and there is significant variability in the quality of the methods used for these projects (Sijm- Eeken et al., 2020)", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}
{"doc": "Patient_Journey_Mapping_and_Healthcare_Service_Design.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2351, "text": ". In some instances, traditional qualitative or quantitative method - ologies have been adapted to describe a patient's experience with a linear approach (Jackson et al., 2012; Mohr et al., 2018; Momen et al., 2013); in others, newly developed mapping tools integrate in - formation from different perspectives and from multiple dimensions (Kelly et al., 2016; Sijm- Eeken et al., 2020). In addition to highlighting methodological variability, Sijm- Eeken et al. (2020) also identify significant variability in the quality of re - porting of patient journey mapping research as problematic. With significant concerns raised across disciplines, and indeed the spec - trum of research methods, issues regarding transparency, rigour and trustworthiness are certainly not limited to patient journey mapping research (Kazak, 2018; Sijm- Eeken et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2007; von Elm et al., 2008)", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}

Investigating the areas of concern that exist in this body of literature may be of value for elevating the quality of reporting in future publications and provide direction to appropriate reporting guidelines. Given the array of approaches to both the map - ping process and the quality of the reporting of this type of research, this scoping review sought to map the literature that documents or utilizes patient journey mapping methodologies in health care and to document and describe the methods and approaches used to report these projects. 2  | THE REVIEW 2.1  |  Aim The aim of this scoping review was to identify how patient journey mapping research is being undertaken and how it is being described and documented in academic literature", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}

Varied use of reporting guidance was seen within the included studies, with very few studies citing or using established reporting guidelines. In a number of articles, diagrammatic figures were used to provide a visual map of patients' journeys, and in others, written descriptions were relied on to document experiences of patients as they traversed health services and systems. This review used two established reporting guidelines to evalu - ate quality of reporting, namely COREQ for qualitative studies and STROBE for quantitative observational studies (Tong et al., 2007; von Elm et al., 2008). In the absence of an appropriate reporting guideline for mixed- methods studies, both the COREQ and STROBE guidelines were also used to evaluate the reporting of the mixed method studies", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}

The results of this evaluation suggest that the qual - ity of reporting is problematic in this emerging field of research, with several gaps existing across all domains of established reporting guidelines. The accurate and detailed reporting of research methods and results is critical if the research being described is to be trusted and useful (Altman & Moher, 2014; Wager & Kleinert, 2010). Two key principles of reporting research include the requirement for authors “to describe their methods clearly and unambiguously so that their findings can be confirmed by others”, and that “researchers should follow applicable reporting guidelines…publications should provide sufficient detail to permit experiments to be repeated by other re - searchers” (Altman & Moher, 2014 , p. 7)", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}

With regards to the former principle, the reporting in the qual - itative and mixed methods studies could have been more clearly articulated, particularly with the descriptions of the personal characteristics of the research team and the methods for data collection and data analysis. In relation to the second principle, reporting guidelines that suit this emerging field of research may not appear to be obvious, however, there are guidelines that may be suitable for use and could have been considered by research - ers. In the comparisons undertaken in this review between in - cluded articles and established reporting guidelines, COREQ and STROBE were used as they are reputable, recognizable and com - prise domains for reporting research elements that largely match the research designs that were used in the included patient jour - ney mapping projects", "year": null, "topics": ["patient-journey", "service-design"], "category": "service-design"}

Inadequate reporting of research projects to participants, the academic and the general public is not an issue that is limited to patient journey mapping, but rather a concern across the research landscape (Taylor, 2019).

It is perhaps a reflection of the novelty of this research that articles included in this review did not all adhere to reporting guides and principles that align with selected methods.

However, the inconsistent, and often inad - equate, reporting of journey mapping research needs to be improved, with authors adhering to principles of accurate, appropriate and comprehensive reporting (Altman & Moher, 2014).

Patient experiences of health services are in - creasingly recognized as vital in the process of system improve - ment and need to be considered in the evolution of health service delivery. Mapping patients' journeys as they traverse health ser - vices and systems is a research approach for capturing patient experiences that is growing in popularity. These projects are pro - viding clarity on the personal experiences of patients and their family members as they move through complex health systems at times when they are experiencing acute or chronic illnesses.

As journeys are being mapped, barriers, enablers and gaps in service delivery are being identified and reported from a patient- centred perspective. Whilst this is an exciting time for the person- centred care movement, there are significant gaps and flaws in the re - porting of many of these projects that hinder transparency and replicability. There are no current reporting guidelines specific to patient journey mapping, and due to the various methodologi - cal approaches, a one- size- fits- all guideline for this type of re - search may not be feasible. Recommendations for future journey mapping projects have been discussed to improve reporting and guide future research.

We used a mixed‐methods approach, drawing on CUBE framework surveys, PPIE feedback forms and impact logs to evaluate involvement. Data were analysed thematically using a ‘ follow‐a‐thread’ approach to identify key issues across sources. Results: Three themes were identified: (1) differing priorities — public contributors prioritised person ‐centred outcomes, while researchers focused on data ‐driven healthcare metrics, often constrained by data availability; (2) movement on both sides— both researchers and contributors expressed early apprehension, but mutual trust and integration developed over time; and (3) the importance of established guidance — many issues raised echoed longstanding PPIE guidance on clarity, feedback and facilitation.

While its growth has often been driven by funder expectations, PPIE has genuine potential to shape priorities and enhance the relevance and impact of research [ 2–4]. The UK Standards for Public Involvement [ 5] outline the principles of good practice, including the use of plain language, inclusivity and timely feedback. A range of methods also exists for evaluating the process and impact of involvement [6]. However, existing guidance often lacks practical procedures for implem entation, particularly in more complex domains", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

However, existing guidance often lacks practical procedures for implem entation, particularly in more complex domains. This paper evaluates PPIE within a research programme exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of multiple long‐term conditions (MLTCs) to highlight some of the challenges and lessons learned when applying PPIE in cross ‐ disciplinary research. 1.1 | Background There has been a rapid growth in AI and ‘ big data’ research over the past decade, alongside increasing interest in their healthcare applications [ 7]. AI is generally defined as computer systems capable of simulating human learning, problem solving or creativity [ 8]. These systems rely on large datasets, often electronic health records, for training and optimisation [ 9]. AI and big data health research raise ethical, social and technical challenges that make a strong case for PPIE [ 10, 11 ]", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "Public_and_Patient_Involvement_in_Data_Driven_Healthcare_Research.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2454, "text": ". AI and big data health research raise ethical, social and technical challenges that make a strong case for PPIE [ 10, 11 ]. For example, the underrepresentation of marginalised groups in health data may produce algorithmic bias and reinforce health inequalities [ 12–15]. The training and decision ‐making processes of AI systems are rarely transparent, making human scrutiny vital [ 16]. Concerns also exist around loss of clinician input, the potential dehumanisation of healthcare [ 17] and risks to data privacy. Media portrayals of AI have fur ther fuelled mistrust and misinformation [18]. Meaningful public involvement has been suggested as a mechanism to address these concerns and ensure AI delivers real patient benefit [12]. Some argue that the public should be active stakeholders in AI governance, not passive recipients [19], and that involvement can help ensure public service values remain central to technological development [20]", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "Public_and_Patient_Involvement_in_Data_Driven_Healthcare_Research.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2455, "text": ". Even in more traditional research settings, PPIE faces known challenges, such as limited researcher confidence or skills, and tension between public and expert perspectives [ 21, 22 ]. These tensions may intensify when public partners are given greater agency. While this may amplify the public voice, it can also generate friction if researchers' goals are shaped by a diverse range of views and experiences [ 23]. In AI and big data health research, these difficulties are compounded by the abstract nature of the field, public unfamiliarity, low baseline knowledge, trust issues and broader social attitudes [13, 24]. Supporting active public involvement in this context may require new methods and more time, for example, to explain data science approaches, data protection and how AI can work with available data. Understanding the challenges of doing this well is key to building effective models for future research", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "Public_and_Patient_Involvement_in_Data_Driven_Healthcare_Research.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2456, "text": ". Understanding the challenges of doing this well is key to building effective models for future research. Despite the wide availability of PPIE guidance, over 500 toolkits are currently in circulation [ 25], most focus on general principles rather than practical implementation [ 26]. None are tailored specifically to AI or big data research. Some include relevant elements, such as building public trust in technology, but overlook challenges around representation, baseline knowledge, digital literacy or inclusive communication [ 12]. Participatory approaches in AI development exist, but often focus on high ‐risk regulation [ 27] or have a commercial orientation [ 28]. These rarely translate well to health and care contexts. 1.2 | A Case Study — AI‐Multiply AI‐Multiply is a large NIHR ‐funded, interdisciplinary project exploring how AI and established analytical approaches can improve care for people with MLTCs and polypharmacy", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

It involves five work packages focused on predicting and understanding disease trajectories (see Box 1). PPIE was embedded from the outset, supported by two public contributor groups: one UK ‐wide (initially 30 members) and a second based in London, facilitated by the charity Social Action for Health. This project presented an unusual PPIE opportunity due to the size of the contributor group, their geographical spread and the diversity of research packages involved (see Section 2). These features created a valuable setting to evaluate PPIE practice in big data and AI research. In this article, we aim to evaluate the implementation of PPIE within AI ‐Multiply and explore the distinct issues and challenges it presented. Our objectives were to identify areas for improvement, understand how AI and big data affect PPIE and offer practical recommendations for future implementation in this domain. 2 | Methods 2.1 | PPIE Group Formation AI‐Multiply involved two PPIE groups", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

These informal, 1 ‐hm e e t i n g sg a v e ECRs opportunities to present technical ideas and receive feedback. Participation grew over time despite early hesitation [31]. Full‐group online workshops were held at the start to build baseline knowledge on AI, data science and the role of PPIE. Later, each work package had at least one dedicated session.

This divergence often reflected a deeper tension: public contributors focused on person‐centred outcomes grounded in lived experience, while researchers were guided by what was feasible within existing data infrastructure and service priorities.

Researchers unfamiliar with PPIE or working in technical fields may lack confidence or question the relevance of involvement. Some are unsure how to share control or integrate public perspectives and may view PPIE as resource ‐ intensive for limited gain [ 38, 39 ]. As recent surveys have shown, researchers want practical guidance and case studies to increase confidence in PPIE, especially in technical contexts [ 21]. In AI ‐Multiply, exposure to PPIE itself led to attitude shifts. As both ECR and Senior researchers saw the value of contributor perspectives and co ‐production dynamics, they became more willing to engage. This suggests that expanding direct experience of PPIE may be as important as formal training. Apprehension also existed among public contributors", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

This suggests that expanding direct experience of PPIE may be as important as formal training. Apprehension also existed among public contributors. Some felt they lacked sufficient expertise in AI or large ‐scale research to contribute meaningfully. This mirrors previous findings showing that limited understanding of technical concepts can restrict involvement [ 40]. The need for baseline understanding is also recognised in commercial AI development [ 28]. Our project's introductory training helped build confidence and establish a foundation for engagement. Beyond training, our approach to integration played a key role in bridging divides. Proactive, flexible PPIE leadership was vital. By embedding contributors into technical meetings and encouraging participation in research outputs, we demonstrated the feasibility, and value, of involving the public in areas often seen as off ‐limits", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "Public_and_Patient_Involvement_in_Data_Driven_Healthcare_Research.pdf", "page": 9, "chunk_id": 2495, "text": ". This required experienced coordination, and our findings suggest this level of integration is novel in such a complex, multi ‐component context. While the value of PPIE coordinators is well established [ 21, 38], our approach demonstrates the added benefit of strategic, persistent leadership to embed contri butors throughout the research lifecycle. We recommend this approach for similar projects. 5.2 | Manage Expectations of Available Data Even as priorities aligned, practical constraints limited how responsive researchers could be. Public contributors offered many valuable ideas that could not be pursued due to missing data in health records. This recurring tension, between public priorities and data availability, does not appear widely documented in the PPIE literature but emerged as a major theme in our study.

Improving EHR data quality is beyond this paper's scope, but addressing gaps could enhance research relevance. Prior work suggests improving existing data quality [ 41] and using patient ‐ reported outcomes tools like those tested in neuroendocrine cancer care [ 42]. Contributors consistently highlighted that quality of life and functional status, rarely recorded in EHRs, were highly important to patients. In the meantime, projects should manage expectations clearly. Contributors must understand the limits of the data and what is achievable. Open dialogue around data constraints can reduce frustration and build trust. The development of the traffic light system to indicate the feasibility of suggested research ideas within AI ‐Multiply is an example of how we managed expectations and encouraged discussion. 5.3 | Get the Basics Right Most feedback from contributors concerned well‐known principles: allowing enough time, sharing materials in advance and providing clear feedback", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

That these principles were still inconsistently applied suggests ongoing barriers to implementation. Among AI researchers, limited awareness of PPIE guidance may be one barrier. PPIE is often not seen as a skill requiring training, yet it involves advanced communication and facilitation, especially in complex domains. Enthusiasm alone is not enough; good PPIE requires preparation and people skills. Incorporating PPIE skills development into the training of ECRs may also raise awareness of these principles. A need for PPIE training early in a research career has been noted previously in a report on the progress of public involvement within NIHR‐funded research [ 44]. Exposing ECRs to PPIE at early stages has been previously acknowledged as a strategy that can build research cultures sensitive to the potential contribution of PPIE and help to develop expertise that is needed to avoid tokenistic involvement [ 16]", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}
{"doc": "Public_and_Patient_Involvement_in_Data_Driven_Healthcare_Research.pdf", "page": 9, "chunk_id": 2498, "text": ". In AI ‐Multiply, our ECRs appreciated opportunities and the benefits of dedicated sessions to directly interact with our PPIE partners in a non ‐threatening forum. Offering similar sessions in other large research projects may help meet this need for skills development. Experienced leadership can help implement basic standards, but building a supportive research culture is also essential. Introducing PPIE training early in research careers may improve awareness and capability. This echoes findings from NIHR reports and other evaluations [ 16, 44 ]. In our project, dedicated ECR –PPIE sessions created a safe space for dialogue. These were well received by both groups and may help address gaps in training. Similar initiatives could support capacity ‐building in other large research programmes. 5.4 | Strengths and Limitations A key strength of this study was the active involvement of public contributors throughout the evaluation process", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

While our findings offer novel insights and suggestions for PPIE in AI and big data research, some limitations must be acknowledged. Our reflections were based on text ‐based feedback in impact logs, along with anonymous quantitative and free‐text data from CUBE surveys. Anonymity likely encouraged honest responses, but one ‐to‐one interviews with researchers and contributors may have yielded more detailed insights and allowed follow ‐up. CUBE survey response rates varied, with as few as eight contributors responding at times. Some public partners reduced involvement or left the project, meaning not all views are represented. Contributors also reported that CUBE question wording was occasionally unclear, which may have limited participation. Following this feedback, we redrafted the questions into a plain English format, which was well received", "year": null, "topics": [], "category": "general"}

Following this feedback, we redrafted the questions into a plain English format, which was well received. Adapting the language to fit the project and public audiences may improve clarity. The evaluation methods that we have employed may have resulted in a bias towards PPIE contributor input and a paucity of researcher perspectives. The CUBE is aimed at gathering the views of PPIE partners, and an equivalent for the research team should be employed. We plan one ‐to‐one interviews with researchers from each work package in AI ‐Multiply to understand their views on PPIE conduct and impact. Our evaluation focused primarily on the ‘ Newcastle’ PPIE group. These contributors were already involved in PPIE across the AI‐Multiply project, and most were experienced in research involvement.

As such, our findings may not reflect the views of contributors from other regional or demographic backgrounds, including the London group. 6 | Implications for Future Practice Our findings will support the development of practical tools for PPIE in complex, data ‐driven health research. After completing further evaluation, including researcher interviews, we aim to co‐produce planning resources that address key challenges: managing expectations around data limitations, embedding contributors in technical spaces and applying PPIE standards consistently across interdisciplinary teams. 7 | Conclusion Our reflections on PPIE in AI ‐Multiply highlight both challenges specific to AI and big data, and those familiar from broader PPIE practice.

Consistent application of existing guidance emerged as one of the most effective strategies. Our experience underscores the effort and time required for meaningful involvement, and the importance of experienced, proactive leadership. By building shared understanding and applying established standards, future projects may be better equipped to integrate public perspectives, though whether this improves research impact remains an open question.

Literature suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled robots may solve such challenges and support person-centered care. There is a dearth of literature exploring the perspectives of health care providers, which are crucial to implementing AI-enabled robots. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore this scant body of literature to answer two questions: (1) what barriers do health care providers perceive in adopting AI-enabled robots in LTC homes? (2) What strategies can be taken to overcome these barriers to the adoption of AI-enabled robots in LTC homes? Methods: We are a team consisting of 3 researchers, 2 health care providers, 2 research trainees, and 1 older adult partner with diverse disciplines in nursing, social work, engineering, and medicine", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}
{"doc": "Robotics_Adoption_in_Healthcare_Operations.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 2520, "text": ". Referring to the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, our team searched databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Scholar) for peer-reviewed and gray literature, screened the literature, and extracted the data. We analyzed the data as a team. We compared our findings with the Person-Centered Practice Framework and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to further our understanding of the findings. Results: This review includes 33 articles that met the inclusion criteria. We identified three barriers to AI-enabled robot adoption: (1) perceived technical complexity and limitation; (2) negative impact, doubted usefulness, and ethical concerns; and (3) resource limitations", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}
{"doc": "Robotics_Adoption_in_Healthcare_Operations.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_id": 2521, "text": ". Strategies to mitigate these barriers were also explored: (1) accommodate the various needs of residents and health care providers, (2) increase the understanding of the benefits of using robots, (3) review and overcome the safety issues, and (4) boost interest in the use of robots and provide training. Conclusions: Previous literature suggested using AI-enabled robots to resolve the challenges of increasing care needs and staff shortages in LTC. Yet, our findings show that health care providers might not use robots because of different considerations. The implication is that the voices of health care providers need to be included in using robots.

LTC health care providers face challenges to meet the increased demand from older adults and their family caregivers due to a dramatically increasing aging population and growing chronic disease burden [2]. Health care providers in LTC homes often engage in repetitive tasks, many involving physical labor, which could lead to a high risk of job stress, physical or emotional exhaustion, burnout, and high turnover, all of which contribute to a lower quality of care [3-5].

Thus, innovative solutions are required to meet LTC home residents’ health care needs and reduce the workload for health care providers. Artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled robots have been perceived as a solution to the crisis in LTC homes, where significant labor shortages will accompany rapidly increasing care demand [6-8]. AI-enabled robots have been used to support person-centered care for older adults and attend to the emotional, social, and physical needs of older adults. For example, PARO, a socially assistive robot, can interact with and provide emotional support for patients with dementia [9]. Physically assistive robots can perform tasks such as dressing and sit-to-stand support [10]. Evidence has suggested that using AI-enabled robots in LTC homes could optimize resources, enhance resident outcomes, create patient-centered care, satisfy residents’ needs, and improve health care providers’workflow [2]", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}

While AI-enabled robots may potentially alleviate the burden on health care workers and enhance efficiency in LTC homes, they also pose risks. Issues associated with AI-enabled robot use were explored in the literature. In LTC homes, the adoption and use of robotics are associated with ethical issues and technological risks such as safety, privacy and data security, liability, and effects on the incumbent workforce [11]. Accordingly, research has been focusing on examining attitudes and perceptions of AI-enabled robots [12]. Recent AI-enabled robot studies evaluate the acceptance of this technology in older users, including in the settings of care facilities, as well as private homes and living lab contexts [13-18]. Findings of the literature show that older adults are generally open to robot assistants, while robots provide social interactions, cognitive stimulation, home-based tasks, personal care, and information management [19,20]", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}
{"doc": "Robotics_Adoption_in_Healthcare_Operations.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 2526, "text": ". However, very few studies have been focused on measuring the health care providers’ perception of AI use, although their acceptance of AI-enabled robots is crucial to future research and development and the implementation of AI-enabled robots in LTC homes [21]. Some studies have shown that approximately 40% of technologies, such as home health care robots and information systems, have been abandoned in the last 2 decades [22,23]. Several barriers to health care providers’adoption of AI-enabled robots were explored, including clinicians’ inadequate knowledge [24] and lack of understanding of the sociotechnical aspects of the technology [24]. These barriers lead to a fear of job loss among health care staff, who are concerned about being replaced by robots for repetitive or manual tasks, even when robots are intended to assist rather than replace workers [21,24]", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}

This scoping review aims to synthesize and analyze the existing literature on the potential barriers and the strategies to overcome these barriers by adopting AI-enabled robots in LTC homes from the perspectives of health care providers. Two research questions guided the review: (1) what barriers do health care providers perceive in adopting AI-enabled robots in LTC homes?

Despite cognitive impairment, person-centered care recognizes that a person living with dementia still has personhood; should be seen as a person; and has diverse needs, such as psychosocial needs, which need to be met by care to achieve the person’s holistic well-being. PCPF provides a framework for understanding the factors influencing the practice of person-centered care with people living with dementia [38,40]. Our review focuses on adopting AI-enabled robots to care for people with dementia. PCPF is, therefore, a good fit for our review.

Sota is designed to give PowerPoint presentations, making use of its versatile communication skills. The robot has a unique communication style, making use of its tone of voice, arm gestures, expressions, body language, and other sounds to convey certain emotions. Sota uses AI to integrate its different skills in a coherent way suitable for presentations. For example, the 3D environment is mapped in real time, and this allows Sota to move around while speaking and point to key features in the presentation. Sota’s voice and gestures are all decided on using AI algorithms that can learn and adapt to audience reactions over time. • Smart Walker [64] • The Smart Walker is an AI-assistive device that is intended to aid individuals with mobility challenges", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}

In addition, in response to health care providers’ comments that SCITOS’s voice was too mechanical, they proposed giving the robot a more attractive, more natural voice. Provide Training and Involve Staff in the Planning and Implementation The last strategy is to provide training.

Huisman and Kort [67], who used the humanoid robot NAO, proposed that the training should give health care providers clear instructions on how to use the robot for physical and recreational activities with residents. They added that time needed to be reserved for training. Otherwise, health care providers could not find time to do the training within their busy work schedules. They also recommended setting up a help desk, which health care providers could contact by phone or email when they encountered any challenges using the robot. When health care providers were more familiar with using the robot, they recommended peer learning (ie, encouraging the health care providers to support each other in using the robot)", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}

Comparing Findings With Theoretical Frameworks Overview As suggested, we compared our findings with PCPF and CFIR to further our understanding of the findings. The authors of PCPF [40] and CFIR [99] suggested that discussing all constructs in 1 paper is not feasible, so they recommended that the users of their framework select a few most relevant constructs to the research. We selected constructs most relevant to our review through team discussions. Comparing Findings With PCPF In our review, one barrier to adopting AI-enabled robots is that health care providers feel that they lack the knowledge and skills to use the robots [70]. One strategy is providing training to health care providers so that they can improve their knowledge and skills [67]", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}

One strategy is providing training to health care providers so that they can improve their knowledge and skills [67]. The knowledge and skills needed to use robots to provide care may be part of “professional competence,” a construct under the “prerequisite” domain of PCPF. This construct refers to “the knowledge, skills and attitudes of the person to negotiate care options and effectively provide holistic care” [36]. Another barrier mentioned in our review is that health care providers are concerned that robots might replace human functions [75]. One strategy is to let health care providers know that they are better at providing these human functions, such as communication, than robots, as they are humans [75].

Robots cannot engage with residents “authentically” because robots are not authentic humans, despite being equipped with AI. “Being sympathetically present” means “an engagement that recognizes the uniqueness and value of the patient by appropriately responding to cues that maximize coping resources through the recognition of important agendas in the person’s life” [36]", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}

This construct made us wonder why health care providers did not mention too much about how the lack of residents’involvement in decision-making was a barrier to the adoption of robots or suggest involving residents’voices in the adoption process, especially since many barriers that the health care providers mentioned were related to the residents, such as potential negative impacts of robots to residents [49,73,74], perceived lack of usefulness of robots to residents [67,77,78], and ethical concerns related to residents [70,80,81]", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}
{"doc": "Robotics_Adoption_in_Healthcare_Operations.pdf", "page": 13, "chunk_id": 2597, "text": ". One explanation might be that health care providers thought that they knew the residents well and could represent the voices of residents, so involving residents in decision-making was not a concern from their perspective. Future studies might examine this further. Another construct is “health and social care/policy” under the “macrocontext” domain of PCPF, which refers to “the decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific health and social care goals within a society” [36].

The “need” construct helps us realize that these barriers are related to health care providers’concerns about the “needs” of residents.

Discussion Principal Findings This scoping review addressed two review questions: (1) health care providers’ perceived barriers to using AI-enabled robots in LTC and (2) the strategies to overcome the barriers to the adoption of robots. We identified the barriers to adopting AI-enabled robots in LTC homes, including (1) perceived technical complexity and limitation; (2) negative impact, doubtfulness, and ethical concerns; and (3) resource limitations. We also identified the strategies to overcome these barriers to adopting AI-enabled robots: (1) accommodate various needs of residents and health care providers, (2) increase the understanding of the benefits of using robots, (3) review and overcome the safety issues, and (4) boost interest in the use of robots and provide training", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}

As suggested in the Introduction section, LTC homes face the challenges of increased resident care needs and a shortage of health care providers [3-5]. Researchers and technology developers expect that AI-enabled robots could address these challenges by sharing the workload of health care providers [6-8]. However, according to the results of our review, health care providers had a different opinion.

Therefore, health care providers’ opinions did not align with researchers’ and technology developers’ expectations that robots could address the challenges in LTC homes. In this scoping review, health care providers identified a few ethical concerns about using AI-enabled robots.

Some ethical concerns mentioned in the paper by Frennert and Östlund [102] were found in our review, including concerns about the privacy of residents [70] and health care providers [82]; deception to residents [81]; infantilization of residents (as many robots, especially social robots, look like a toy) [80]; equitable distribution of the use of robots in a group setting [11]; and residents’ attachment to the robots and negative emotions triggered when they break down [70]", "year": null, "topics": ["robotics"], "category": "technology"}

In our scoping review, for example, in the study by Erebak and Turgut [76], health care providers mentioned specifically the control of decision-making. One possible reason health care providers in our scoping review highlighted the control of decision-making is that among different aspects of control of AI-enabled robots, decision-making is a key feature of AI that is widely discussed in society [103]. In our review, health care providers had different opinions on whether the AI-enabled robots should look real.

A user-centered design approach was used to identify older adults’ perspectives regarding AAL and AI technologies and gauge interest in participating in a co-design process. A survey was used to obtain demographic characteristics and assess privacy perspectives.

These declines, which can occur with advanced age, are key barriers to one’s ability to maintain an independent lifestyle [5,6]. This often leads to more signiﬁcant mental and physical decline, as well as quality of life decline and increased cost of care, compared to older adults who continue to live independently [7]. As a result, effective means of providing support for older adults are of central public health and ethical signiﬁcance. In many cases, external aids provide crucially needed assistance that can prolong independent living. Technologies, such as internet of things (IoT), Ambient/Active Assisted Living (AAL) robots and other artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), have been shown to have great potential in fostering independent living, improving mental and physical health, and increasing quality of life [8–11]", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

At the same time, they can also reduce caregiver burden, which can lead to more targeted and better quality care [12]. However, despite playing a signiﬁcant part in successful interventions, adoption of these technologies has been limited [13,14]. One key barrier to wider adoption has been the “top-down” design process that is often used in creating technology for older adults. This process is based on technologists’, or at best geriatricians’, preconceptions of the needs of older adults with little consideration of user perspectives and preferences or their real-world constraints. While there are a number of studies that have indicated the need for well-designed technologies that meet the needs of older adults [15], few have addressed user-related issues in the design process of these technologies", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

It has been recognized that effective technologies are those that prioritize the needs and wishes of older adults, general acceptance of potential users, and suitable preconditions for its adoption [16], but this is often difﬁcult to achieve with a top-down design methodology that fails to engage users in the design process. This has frequently created signiﬁcant mismatches between the needs and preferences of the users and the products that are developed to fulﬁll their needs. Areas of concern for users include visual appearance, functionality, affordability, platform sustainability, privacy concerns, and interaction complexity [ 17–19].

Employment of user- or human-centered design (HCD) involves the end user in the early planning phases to better understand the needs of individuals for whom a product is being developed and to ensure relevant safety, access, and utility are built in [ 20].

Materials and Methods 2.1.

Survey A survey was used to obtain demographic characteristics of the participants with the four scales designed to measure privacy attitudes described below: Westin Privacy Segmentation Index The Westin Privacy Segmentation Index (PSI) is used to classify participants into three groups: Privacy Fundamentalists, Privacy Unconcerned, and Privacy Pragmatists [24]. The PSI consists of three questions that assess whether consumers trust businesses and regulations to safeguard their privacy. Westin Privacy Concern Index The Privacy Concern Index (PCI) is another scale that was developed by Westin et al. in the 1990s [24]. Scoring is used to classify participants into three groups: high, medium, and low with respect to the level of privacy concern. The PCI used for this study included ﬁve questions from the original six-item version. One item regarding the creation of a privacy commission by the government was omitted as it was unrelated to the present study", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

Technology Usability The theme of “technology usability” was deﬁned by how accessible a product is to those attempting to use it. Sub-themes point to barriers around user interface making intuitive navigation of a product difﬁcult, and physical challenges that become obvious when technologies are not designed for the older demographic. 3.1.1. Lack of Uniﬁed Frameworks and User Interfaces Because of the fragmentation of different digital platforms and services, there are many cases where the lack of a uniﬁed user interface can lead to increased user frustration and compromise usability. For example, one participant was trying to set up an email service and expressed frustration with navigating what should have been a fairly routine task. “To get email hooked up, to get this done, to get the keyboard . . . all that stuff, and a lot of folks just give up.” Another purchased a backup system for her computer, but had no idea how to set it up", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

My kids think I can use this, but I don’t really know how to use this, and they bought it for me thinking it would be a great tool, but I don’t really know what to do with it.” Devices that were easy to use due to having simple features, such as the “on/off” switch for an electronic toothbrush, or plugs that worked regardless of how you inserted it (i.e., the Apple Lightning", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

Lastly, concerns were voiced about technologies that introduce hazards to older adults, such as the use of power cords. Since having power cords around the house creates a tripping hazard and fall risk, several participants advocated for more wireless functionality. 3.1.2. Increased Mobility and Visual Challenges When Using Technologies Older adults often face challenges in accessing hardware features or digital content due to a lack of accommodation of their limitations in mobility and decreased visual capacity. In some cases, the technology is designed to keep the battery charge connection out of sight—perhaps for aesthetics or weather prooﬁng.

Discussion The growth of general purpose and healthcare-related technologies has created the potential to help more older adults to age in place. Living independently is preferred by older adults and smart technologies like IoT, AI, and AAL can provide the necessary assistance. Due to improvements in communication and remote data gathering capabilities by healthcare providers and researchers, operationalizing smart communities will become more dependent than ever on sensors and predictive analytics of collected data. The results from this study reveal barriers to the adoption of technologies and facilitators that could foster increased access to and usability of technologies to support independent living", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

Factors identiﬁed through this study were: (1) technology usability, (2) technology literacy, (3) data management, (4) privacy attitudes, and (5) co-design. 4.1. Technology Usability Older adults in our study tended to associate adoption of new technologies with a lack of conﬁdence in their ability to understand or access them. A signiﬁcant source of frustration in their interactions with digital products lay in the inadequacies in software and hardware interfaces that permit access to different functionalities. Participants gave examples of technologies they interacted with every day and identiﬁed speciﬁc examples of problems with their access to these technologies. The physical decline that can occur as people age creates physical access barriers in technologies. These can be attributed to the dimensions and locations of certain components and how they interface with power sources and other technologies to conduct data transfer or data input", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}
{"doc": "Technology_Supporting_Aging_in_Place_User_Perspectives.pdf", "page": 11, "chunk_id": 2703, "text": ". Another noticeable concern in physical access is the existence, or lack thereof, of visibility enhancement features. Visual aids are often inadequate or poorly designed for common use cases that can allow for easier access to content displayed in a visual medium. It has been suggested that a key motivation in technology adoption by older adults is the presence of a signiﬁcant perceived beneﬁt [31]. Despite the fact that many participants in the study indicated ownership of a diverse set of modern devices, many of the features that participants wished for in future technologies already existed on the personal devices they already possessed. The lack of knowledge of the existence of these functionalities can vastly diminish the perceived potential of many technologies, affecting adoption or continual usage. 4.2.

Software Interface The software interface is also a potential source of friction for older adults. Lack of familiarity with and understanding of technology can make it difﬁcult for older adults to be at ease while operating user interfaces. Because older adults were not introduced to modern digital work environments until later in life (or in many cases not at all), their ability to adapt to changes is hindered by a lack of fundamental knowledge in how digital infrastructures operate and how data is utilized. While the lack of understanding in operating a device could be alleviated somewhat by instructional material documenting steps to access functionalities, older adults tend to rely on static content, such as printed manuals, to fulﬁll this need. Few participants in the study were capable of effectively utilizing online instructional and troubleshooting materials.

The vocabulary was often unfamiliar (e.g., Bluetooth) and proved meaningless when trying to understand instructions.

This has created ﬂuid interfaces that change without warning, quickly rendering previous usability knowledge and documentation obsolete. This unpredictability is especially problematic with the fragmentation in interface philosophies on different digital platforms, necessitating repeated familiarization processes to keep pace with the latest changes. How to make these incremental updates while considering the impact on the digital novices is important if we are to design for needs of an older demographic. 4.3.

This mistrust and misunderstanding of the handling of data can be an especially serious obstacle to the adoption of technology that requires large amounts of personal data to be effective, such as machine learning algorithms. Another concern voiced by the participants was a lack of feedback from data collected by digital devices or researchers. The awareness subscale in IUIPC showed that 70% of the participants were aware of the online information collection and strongly agreed that disclosure of information usage is important.

This is particularly an area of interest for digital health research, where the data collected and their analysis can be of high interest to the participants who are concerned about their health. At the same time, it is often unclear how to return the data back to the research participants in a manner that is meaningful to them. In traditional clinical research, research data are rarely returned to the participants. As such, there is a lack of a clear pathway to determine what would be meaningful (e.g., raw data or a short report) nor how often to provide feedback. The answer is likely to be person-speciﬁc—for instance, a person who requests and can process complex information versus someone who is satisﬁed with a very brief summary", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

Implications for Creating Age-Friendly Communities As the number of older adults increases, the World Health Organization has initiated a movement to establish age-friendly communities [ 32]. An important component of this initiative should be identifying technologies that support aging in place. Our early stage HCD research sheds light on important issues that are unique to older adults speciﬁc to privacy and technology literacy. Engagement of older adults in the design of technologies is often overlooked or an afterthought. Technologies that are commonly used by older adults are often developed without consulting them at the early stage of product conception. This top-down design model means that user input is only received by the product developer after it is completed, making it much harder to alter in order to ﬁt user needs", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}
{"doc": "Technology_Supporting_Aging_in_Place_User_Perspectives.pdf", "page": 12, "chunk_id": 2710, "text": ". Our study showed that older adults are experts in their lived experiences and can identify the potential barriers to technology adoption and use. In this study, participants voiced their concerns about technologies they interacted with daily, albeit with varying levels of success, and offered ideas for how to improve these products. One issue was their lack of understanding of fundamental technology concepts. A common barrier to the participatory design process involving older adults is the lack of expertise in product development and programming [33]. Because of this technology literacy gap, there is signiﬁcant potential value in providing an educational component in the co-design process to overcome this issue. While impractical to educate older adults on more complicated topics in computer science and human computer interaction, basic knowledge about current technologies and how they interact with each other would be immensely valuable", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

An eye scanning or ﬁnger print sensor that could be used to unlock the door of the residence, or a system that mimics the proximity-based keyless lock system on modern cars, was suggested by a participant. By gaining a high-level understanding, the resulting ideas and concepts generated by older adults can be more meaningful, particularly in the prototyping stage of the participatory design process, where practical knowledge is needed [34]. In addition to the understandability and usability of different technologies, concerns were raised by participants over the use of data and the importance of privacy and control.

At the same time, they were also reluctant about sharing data of other categories due to hacking or data loss concerns. This indicates the importance of addressing privacy concerns in different scenarios for different technologies. A participatory design process that values privacy could be a key factor in improving user adoption. By including residents in this formative research, we were able to identify what would be needed to engage older adults in the design process in a meaningful way and what they would like to receive in the form of feedback.

Limitations The results presented here are part of a larger study to determine how AI can be used to assess individual cognitive and physical status through the use of traditional means and sensor technologies.

Conclusions This study demonstrates the signiﬁcant gap that exists between the potential beneﬁts offered by technologies such as AI and other AAI and the barriers that plague older adults in the adoption of these technologies. Education is critical not only for older adults, but also for technologists. While increasing “technology literacy” of older adults can provide meaningful improvements in helping these users interact more successfully with technology, we also must address the need to educate technology creators about older adults—i.e., increasing “aging literacy” of technologists. This education can occur through pragmatic exercises that involve partnering with older adults to design future technologies", "year": null, "topics": ["aging-in-place"], "category": "technology"}

Rather than intervening after a product is in the market place, we can preempt the problems introduced by low technology literacy and fundamentalist privacy attitudes. Moreover, feedback loops can be built in that will help older adults to better understand their data and how these data are used to predict their healthcare needs.
